The following is some information regarding the 15 week iCourse section (103/203/403) of the course Math 112 that I will be assisting with during Spring 2021. 

*Our section has about 80 students. The full course has about 1400 students.*

**Instructor:** [Michael Rossetti](https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/mrrossetti)

**Teaching Assistant:** Gaurish Korpal (GTA), Jessica Elliott (UTA)


* **Course syllabus and background needed for the course:** Topics include properties of functions and graphs, linear and quadratic equations, polynomial functions, exponential and logarithmic functions with applications. For this course we will be using Desmos as the graphing calculator. The textbook for the course is provided as an electronic textbook in [ALEKS](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/curriculum.pdf). Another recommended reading material is the "Math 112 Guided Workbook" (can download pdf from [D2L](https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/loginh/). For this class you will need daily access to a laptop or web-enabled device with webcam and microphone, and regular access to reliable internet. The course work will take place in Microsoft Teams, D2L and Gradescope.  For lecture recordings, students will access content in D2L and Microsoft Teams.

There will be 24 ALEKS HW assignments, 6 ALEKS Quizzes, 6 Gradescope Written HW and 6 Gradescope Group Assignments. You will be able to access all these via D2L portal.

* **Exams:** There will 3 unit (“Midterm”) exams and a final exam, the unit exams will proctored via Examity and the final exam will be proctered via Zoom.
