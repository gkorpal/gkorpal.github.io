The following is some information regarding the section 033 of the course MATH 112 that I will be assisting with during Fall 2019. 

*The full course has about 2000 students.*


**Course Coordinators:** [Dr. Brenae Bailey](https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/bbailey) and [Taryn Laird](https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/tarynl)

**Instructor:** [Mitchell James Wilson](https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/mjw)

**Teaching Assistant:** Gaurish Korpal


* **Course syllabus and background needed for the course:** Topics include properties of functions and graphs, linear and quadratic equations, polynomial functions, exponential and logarithmic functions with applications. A graphing calculator is required for this course. We recommend the TI-83 or TI-84 models ([details](https://www.math.arizona.edu/academics/calculators/)). The entry into this course is by having appropriate score in SAT I MSS,  ACT MATH, or ALEKS PPL test ([details](https://www.math.arizona.edu/academics/placement/courses)). The textbook for the course is provided as an electronic textbook in [ALEKS](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/curriculum.pdf). Another recommended reading material is the "Math 112 Guided Workbook" (can download pdf from [D2L](https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/loginh/) or buy printed copy from the [UA Bookstore](https://uabookstore.arizona.edu/)).

* **Homework assignments:** There are 2 components to homework: ALEKS Assignments and Written Homework. There will be several online homework assignments this semester, posted in ALEKS. There will be 14 written work assignments, posted by the instructor in D2L. Each question will be provided on a pre-formatted sheet that will have space for the student to show their detailed solutions. Students must print the assignment and handwrite all work on the printed assignment or will incur a small penalty. We will use a web program called [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) to upload our written homework assignments this semester. Students can connect to our Gradescope page directly via D2L. Submissions must be in pdf format and the pages must be posted in the correct order.

* **Quizzes and exams:** There will be about 12 in-class quizzes, to gauge students’ understanding on the topics discussed in class. Quizzes may be worked cooperatively with a group or taken individually. The instructor will indicate the format for each quiz. There will 3 unit (“Midterm”) exams and a final exam, all given in person and all written by the course coordinators. All unit exams are given at common times outside of class. The final exam is given at a common time according to the final exam schedule posted by The University of Arizona
