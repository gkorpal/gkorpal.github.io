The following is some information regarding the 15 week iCourse section (103/203/403) of the course Math 112 that I will be assisting with during Fall 2020. 

*Our section has about 114 students. The full course has about 1700 students.*


**Course Coordinators:** [Taryn Laird](https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/tarynl), [Mitchell James Wilson](https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/mjw) and [Catherine Yslas](https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/cmyslas)

**Instructor:** [Michael Rossetti](https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/mrrossetti)

**Teaching Assistants:** Gaurish Korpal, Tristan Phillips


* **Course syllabus:** Topics include properties of functions and graphs, linear and quadratic equations, polynomial functions, exponential and logarithmic functions with applications. For this course we will be using Desmos as the graphing calculator. The textbook for the course is provided as an electronic textbook in [ALEKS](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/curriculum.pdf). Another recommended reading material is the "Math 112 Guided Workbook" (can download pdf from [D2L](https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/loginh/). For this class you will need daily access to a laptop or web-enabled device with webcam and microphone, and regular access to reliable internet. The course work will take place in Microsoft Teams, D2L and Gradescope.  For lecture recordings, students will access content in D2L and Microsoft Teams.

* **Homework assignments:** There are 4 components to homework: ALEKS HW, ALEKS Quizzes, Gradescope Written HW and Gradescope Group Work. There will be 25 ALEKS HW assignments, 6 ALEKS Quizzes, 7 Gradescope Written HW and 6 Gradescope Group Assignments. You will be able to access all these via D2L portal.

* **Exams:** There will 3 unit (“Midterm”) exams and a final exam, all proctored via Zoom and written by the course coordinators. All unit exams will have a choice of three common times to choose from (to overcome the timezone differences). The final exam is given at a common time according to the final exam schedule posted by The University of Arizona.
  * Midterm 1: Monday, September 28, 2020, 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM or 7:00 PM - 8:00 PM (Arizona Time)
    * Topics: Functions, Graphs of Functions, Linear Functions, Piecewise Linear Functions, Transformations of Functions
  * Midterm 2: Monday, October 26, 2020
    * Topics: Combining Functions, Inverse Functions, Quadratic Functions, Polynomial Functions
  * Midterm 3: Friday, November 20, 2020
    * Topics: Rational Functions, Exponential Functions, Logarithmic Functions, Properties of Logarithms, Exponential and
