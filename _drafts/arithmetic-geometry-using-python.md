Doing arithmetic geometry using Python 3

# Resources

Ideally, one should have computer science background equivalent to this [Coursera specialization by Rice University](https://online.rice.edu/courses/computer-fundamentals/). However, I don't have that much time or patience. Therefore, I will rely on the [following resources](https://legacy.python.org/workshops/2002-02/papers/15/index.htm).

| Resource | Description |
| --------- | ----- |
| [Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-third-edition) | This is the textbook for the edX MOOC series [Computational Thinking using Python](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-computational-thinking-using-python) and MIT OCW [6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/6-0001F16) + [6.0002](http://ocw.mit.edu/6-0002F16).|
| [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://fbeedle.com/our-books/10-problem-solving-with-algorithms-and-data-structures-using-python-2nd-ed-9781590282571.html) | I came to know about this book from the MIT OCW [Introduction to Algorithms](http://ocw.mit.edu/6-006F11) which follows [the standard textbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) with an added emphasis on using Python for solving exercises. This book is also available in [online textbook format](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html), however you will need to use an adblocker or [host it yourself](https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/pythonds).|
| [Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/) |  Practice solving computational problems using computer programs. |
