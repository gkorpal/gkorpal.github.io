Doing arithmetic geometry using Python 3

# Resources

Ideally, one should have computer science background equivalent to this [Coursera specialization by Rice University](https://online.rice.edu/courses/computer-fundamentals/). However, I don't have that much time or patience. Therefore, I will rely on the following resources.

| Resource | Description |
| --------- | ----- |
| [Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-third-edition) | This is the textbook for the edX MOOC series [Computational Thinking using Python](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-computational-thinking-using-python).|
| [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) | Online textbook that uses Python instead of pseudo-codes. To avoid advertisements either use adblocker or [build it and host it yourself](https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/pythonds).|
| [Introduction to Algorithms](http://ocw.mit.edu/6-006F11) | MIT OCW based on [the standard textbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) and added emphasis on using Python for solving exercises.|
