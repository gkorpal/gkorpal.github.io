The [Nexus 7](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/nexus-7.pdf) is one of the best piece of hardware I ever owned, but it lacked good quality acccesories. Moreover, in my opinion, [Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/s6-lite.pdf) is a modified version of [Samsung Google Nexus 10](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/nexus-10.pdf) with added Wacom drawing tablet functionality, reduced screen resolution, and removed camera-flash ([full comparison](https://versus.com/en/google-nexus-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-wi-fi)). On the other hand, [Samsung Galaxy Tab S series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_series#Tablets) in general have filled the void left by [Google Pixel C](https://support.google.com/pixel/pixel-c/?hl=en#topic=7186644) after Google dumped Android in favor of ChromeOS tablet [Google Pixel Slate](https://support.google.com/pixelslate/#topic=9116377) which supported Pixelbook Pen (Wacom's AAAA-battery AES pen).

Initially, since reading was the main purpose of the tablet, I tried replacing my older tablet with [Kindle Paperwhite (3rd generation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_Paperwhite_(third_generation)). However, its small screen made it impossible to quickly jump between the pages of the large documents. Moreover, to be able to read pdf/DjVu files properly, one first has to optimize them for viewing using [k2pdfopt](https://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/) or [jailbreak kindle](https://decryptronics.github.io/electronics/2020/07/12/jailbreaking-my-kindle-paperwhite-3.html) (complicated). Another adavantage of using a tablet PC instead of an e-reader is that nowadays there are many open source online textbooks available, like [The Stacks project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/) and [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mathematics).

For Apple products you pay the premium price for better support but at the same time limited by the company. I feel suffocated by Microsoft/Apple/Amazon devices since you pay them to control your choices, whereas with open-source approach taken by Google, people are allowed to experiment. Moreover, Android updates, like Linux, are modular. For example, Google Pixel 3a (USD 399 + taxes) was released with Android 9 (May 2019) and is supposed to be supported for at least 3 years (May 2022) i.e. until Android 12. What this means is that, it will be safe to use Pixel 3a for
