Following is the comparison of tech specs of my new tablet (USD 315 + taxes) with the older tablet (USD 280 + taxes):

| Specification | Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite | Asus Google Nexus 7 (2nd generation) |
| --------------| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CPU | Samsung Exynos 9610 (2.3GHz x 4 cores, Cortex-A73 + 1.7GHz x 4 cores, Cortex-A53) | Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro APQ8064 (1.5GHz x 4 cores, Krait 300)|
| iGPU | Arm	Mali-G72 (850MHz, Bifrost) | Qualcomm Adreno 320 (400MHz, Ardeno)|
| RAM | 4GB | 2GB |
|Storage | 64GB eMMC |  32GB eMMC|
|Battery | 7040 mAh | 3950 mAh|
| OS | One UI 2.1 on Android 10.0 ([updated](https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb) no sooner than 3 months) | Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, upgraded until Android 6 Marshmallow | 

Initially, since reading was the main purpose of the tablet, I tried replacing my older tablet with [Kindle Paperwhite (3rd generation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_Paperwhite_(third_generation)).

Moreover, to be able to read pdf/DjVu files properly, one first has to optimize them for viewing using [k2pdfopt](https://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/) or [jailbreak kindle](https://decryptronics.github.io/electronics/2020/07/12/jailbreaking-my-kindle-paperwhite-3.html) (complicated). Another adavantage of using a tablet PC instead of an e-reader is that nowadays there are many open source online textbooks available, like [The Stacks project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/) and [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mathematics).

For Apple products you pay the premium price for better support but at the same time limited by the company. I feel suffocated by Microsoft/Apple/Amazon devices since you pay them to control your choices, whereas with open-source approach taken by Google, people are allowed to experiment. Moreover, Android updates, like Linux, are modular. For example, Google Pixel 3a (USD 399 + taxes) was released with Android 9 (May 2019) and is supposed to be supported for at least 3 years (May 2022) i.e. until Android 12. What this means is that, it will be safe to use Pixel 3a for
