Following is the comparison of tech specs of my new tablet (USD 315 + taxes) with the older tablet (USD 280 + taxes):

| Specification | Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite | Asus Google Nexus 7 (2nd generation) |
| --------------| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CPU | Samsung Exynos 9610 (2.3GHz x 4 cores, Cortex-A73 + 1.7GHz x 4 cores, Cortex-A53) | Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro APQ8064 (1.5GHz x 4 cores, Krait 300)|
| iGPU | Arm	Mali-G72 (850MHz, Bifrost) | Qualcomm Adreno 320 (400MHz, Ardeno)|
| RAM | 4GB | 2GB |
|Storage | 64GB eMMC |  32GB eMMC|
|Battery | 7040 mAh | 3950 mAh|

Initially, since reading was the main purpose of the tablet, I tried replacing it with [Kindle Paperwhite (3rd generation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_Paperwhite_(third_generation)). However, its small screen made it impossible to quickly jump between the pages of the large documents. Moreover, to be able to read pdf/DjVu files properly, one first has to optimize them for viewing using [k2pdfopt](https://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/) or [jailbreak kindle](https://decryptronics.github.io/electronics/2020/07/12/jailbreaking-my-kindle-paperwhite-3.html) (complicated).
