## Pre COVID ##
The laptop that I got when I joined college 5 years ago was now old enough to be replaced. Mostly because I picked all the wrong specs when there was a choice (like Realtek vs Intel wireless, 2x4 GB RAM vs 1x8GB RAM, 48Wh vs 62 Wh battery) and my lack of maintenance (never cleaned dust from inside or the rust from the ports). So I wanted something portable that can allow me to browse internet and write homework assignments in LaTeX. Following is the comparison of my new laptop (USD 375 before taxes) with the older laptop (USD 916 before taxes) :


| Specification | ASUS Chromebook 14 C425 (C425TA-DH384) | ThinkPad E440 (Custom build) |
| ------------- |:--------------------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
|CPU            | Intel Core m3-8100Y (1.1 GHz x 2 cores, Amber Lake Y)    | Intel Core i7-4702MQ (2.20 GHz x 4 cores, Haswell)|
|iGPU            | Intel UHD Graphics 615  (300 MHz, Gen. 9 Amber Lake)  | 
Intel HD Graphics 4600 (400 MHz, Gen. 7.5 Haswell)|
|RAM | 2 x 4 GBLPDDR3 1866 MHz SO-DIMM            | 8GB PC3-12800 DDR3L SDRAM 1600 MHz SO-DIMM|
|Storage| Crucial P1 500GB NVMe SSD  | Samsung PM991 512GB NVMe SSD|
|Ports| PS/2, 5 x USB 3.2, 4 x USB 2.0, DVI-D, HDMI, Audio In/Out, 2 x Mic| 1 x USB Type-C, 1 x USB 3.2, 1 x USB 2.0, HDMI, Headset/speaker jack|
|Network| Realtek Gigabit Ethernet (upto 1 Gbps) | Intel Bluetooth 5.0 and WiFi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax, upto 10 Gbps) |
|Audio| Realtek ALC892 Codec| Realtek Audio |
|Display | 21.5" 1080p IPS with Eye Care and 2 stereo speakers| 14" 1080p IPS with Bluelight Shiel and 2 stereo speakers|
|Webcam | 720p with mic| 720p with mic|
|Keyboard | Tenkeyless mechanical with Outemu Blue switches  | 60% size chiclet with scissor switch and backlight|
|Pointing device | Wireless mouse | Touchpad |
|Warranty |  2-5 years on expensive parts | 1 year|
|Bottomline | Customizability (optimized for Ubuntu and LaTeX) | Mobility (0.71" thin and 2. 65 lbs) |

Ryzen 7 4700U is about 20% better than Ryzen 3 3200G for LaTeX ([single core performance](https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/compare_cpu-amd_ryzen_3_3200g-952-vs-amd_ryzen_7_4700u-1093)).
