During my PhD I had to resort to using WSL because university required Microsoft and Adobe software. However, WSL is wasteful because of useless host: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#main-wsl-settings

This pose is a continuation of https://gkorpal.github.io/posts/2020/08/fedora/

This is my attempt to create something inspired by up-to-date packages and kernel of Fedora, KDE of OpenSUSE, and large package availability of Ubuntu. I desire a bit more control over my machine than ofference by these three.

## Installation steps:
I learned about the process from the [official guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) and supplemented it with the notes by [Michele Gementi](https://gist.github.com/mjkstra/96ce7a5689d753e7a6bdd92cdc169bae), [Max Pershin](https://github.com/silentz/arch-linux-install-guide), [Abhishek Prakash](https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/), [Gentoo guide](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Disks#Partitioning_the_disk_with_GPT_for_UEFI) and [Ubuntu guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq).

1. Download the latest ISO from U of A's mirror: https://mirror.arizona.edu/
2. Create a bootable USB drive using Ventoy: https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_start.html
3. Disable secure boot: https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht509044-how-to-enable-secure-boot-on-think-branded-systems-thinkpad-thinkstation-thinkcentre
4. Boot from the USB drive and select Arch Linux. Will get logged in on the first virtual console as the root user, and presented with a Zsh shell prompt.
5. Verify that the boot mode is UEFI by ensuring that the following command returns 64.
    ````
    $ cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size
    ````
6. Connect to WiFi using `iwctl`.
    ````
    $ iwctl
    [iwd]# device list
    [iwd]# station <device-name> scan
    [iwd]# station <device-name> get-networks
    [iwd]# station <device-name> connect <Name of WiFi access point>
    [iwd]# exit
    $ ping -c 5 ping.archlinux.org
    ````
7. Ensure that the system clock is syncronized using  `timedatectl`
8. Use `cfdisk` to create the following GUID Partition Table (GPT), without hibernation feature (suspend-to-disk).
    | Mount point | Parition type | Size |
    | ----------- | ------------- | ---- |
    | `/efi`     |  EFI System Partition | 1 GiB |
    | `[swap]`    | Linux swap |  6 GiB |
    | `/`         | Linux Filesystem | (all of the remaining space ) |
9. Format the partitions using `mkfs`
    ````
    $ mkfs.btrfs </dev/root_partition>
    $ mkfs.fat -F 32 </dev/efi_system_partition>
    $ mkswap </dev/swap_partition>
   
    ````
10. Mount the file systems
    ````
    $ mount </dev/root_partition> /mnt
    $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@
    $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@home
    $ umount /mnt
    $ mount -o compress=zstd,subvol=@ </dev/root_partition> /mnt
    $ mkdir -p /mnt/home
    $ mount -o compress=zstd,subvol=@home </dev/root_partition> /mnt/home
    $ mkdir -p /mnt/efi
    $ mount </dev/efi_system_partition> /mnt/efi
    $ swapon </dev/swap_partition>
    ````
11.
