During my PhD I had to resort to using WSL because university required Microsoft and Adobe software. However, WSL is wasteful because of useless host: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#main-wsl-settings

This pose is a continuation of https://gkorpal.github.io/posts/2020/08/fedora/

This is my attempt to create something inspired by up-to-date packages and kernel of Fedora, KDE of OpenSUSE, and large package availability of Ubuntu. I desire a bit more control over my machine than ofference by these three.
