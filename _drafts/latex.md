Arch way of doing stuff.

The plan is to use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) as the text-editor and [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) as the pdf-viewer since both can be accessed solely via keyboard, while keeping all the good features from the GTK+ based LaTex editors like "live pdf preview" from [Gummi](https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi) and "forward and backward search to switch between the sources and the PDF" from [GNOME LaTeX](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/GNOME-LaTeX).
