The plan is to use [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the programming language for doing some calculations in arithmetic geometry.

# Python configuration

We will need the following packages to begin with:

| Software Program | dnf Package |
|----------|----------|
|[Python3](https://fedoralovespython.org/) |`python3`|
|[SymPy](https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech/languages/python/scipy.html) | `python3-sympy`|
|[CyPARI2](https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2) | `python3-cypari2`|


If you want GUI version of Python then can get [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) by installing the package `python3-idle`. Once you finish learning basics using the free ["Hands-on Python Tutorial" by Andrew N. Harrington](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/) or the [tutorial available in the official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/), you are ready to start using Python for solving math problems.
