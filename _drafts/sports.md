An academic career is very much similar to that of sportsperson. Just like a sportsperson, an academician need to excel in their craft. There do exists people who excel on both fronts [NFL](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~sdmiller/Cryptanalysis-of-the-NFL-Schedule.html/) [Olympics](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/news/austria-s-anna-kiesenhofer-wins-shock-cycling-gold-in-women-s-road-race)

Teaching is a suffocating job. You are just cog in a big machine milking young people by giving them false hope of financial security. Everything has to be graded, follow a protocol. Teachers are supposed to evaluate students who are taking a course just to meet the degree requirements. Students are supposed to evaluate teachers who have very limited control over curriculum. Where is the learning? Mistakes can lead to loss of scholarship. Nobody can learn without making mistakes. Education system just sell fake dreams to create worker bees. No path breaking development has ever happened while being confined within the limits of freedom. However, this freedom is a luxory only available to a few fortunate people. Most of our idols are the ones who challenged the system and achieved some success.

Sports are just one form of entertainment in which a person's genetic superiority is rewarded, just like any other profession.
