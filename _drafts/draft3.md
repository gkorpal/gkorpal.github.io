The main use of my new PC is to write documents in LaTeX, hence it would be essential to have easy access to the latest version of texlive and text-editor (like Vim). However, stable Debian-based distros (like Debian Stable, Ubuntu LTS and Linux Mint) tend to have outdated repositories of both of these (since they are not updated over a span of five years). Moreover, compiling them from sources can be a bit tricky (eg:  installing [TexLive](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092/73743) and [Vim](https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/10817/30343)). Hence I felt the need to migrate to a distro which can give easy access to latest version of these programs. But I don't have enough knowledge to be able to maintain the stability of rolling-release distros like Arch, openSUSE and Gentoo. Therefore, since I don't need any proprietary drivers, I decided to take a middle ground and shift to the pseudo-rolling/stable-release distro Fedora (13 month life cycle) which is the upstream source of the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution. Another reason for choosing Fedora was that its community is more knowledgebable (RedHat is [one of the biggest contributer](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-leads-open-source-contributions-to-kernel) to Linux kernel).
