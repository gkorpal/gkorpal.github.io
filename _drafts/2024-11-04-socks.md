Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions - Problem 1

Let $N=r+b$ be the total number of socks, where $r$ is the number of red socks and $b$ is the number of black socks. Then as per the problem

<p style="text-align:center;">$\displaystyle{\frac{r(r-1)}{N(N-1)} = \frac{1}{2}}$</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$\displaystyle{2r(r-1) = N(N-1)}$</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$\displaystyle{2 (4r^2 - 4r + 1 - 1) = 4N^2 - 4N + 1 - 1}$</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$\displaystyle{2(2r-1)^2 - 2 = (2N-1)^2 - 1}$</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$\displaystyle{(2N-1)^2 - 2(2r-1)^2 = -1}$</p>

For $X=2N-1$ and $Y=2r-1$, we get the Pell's equation: $X^2 - 2Y^2 = -1$. Note that we also have an extra condition that $X>Y$, hence the primitive solution $X_0=Y_0=1$ doesn't work. However, from this, we can get other solutions like $X_{n+1}=3X_{n} + 4Y_{n}$ and $Y_{n+1} = 2X_{n} + 3Y_{n}$. In particular, $X_1 = 7$ and $Y_1=5$ leads to the first viable solution $N=4$, $r=3$, and $b=1$. Next, $X_2 = 41$ an $Y_2= 29$ leads to the second solution $N=21$, $r=15$ and $b=6$.
