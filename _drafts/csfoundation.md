Cypherpunks write code ([*A Cypherpunk's Manifesto* - Eric Hughes, 1993](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)). Therefore, to get started, I want to work on various challenges of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/). However, there are [many programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages) to choose from. For example, following are some of the main programming languages developed before the Internet age (source: Programming Languages - Principles and Practice, by Louden & Lambert, 3rd ed)

Therefore, I spent one year learning the basics computer science following the advice from other CS majors/professors:

Eventually, I plan to participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions like [CrytoHack](https://cryptohack.org/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/).
