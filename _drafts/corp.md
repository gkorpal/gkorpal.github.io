Free and open-source software are great because they allow transparency and technical superiority. In fact, this is good enough incentive for many big corporations like Intel (Open Source Technology Center), IBM (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), Microsoft (Azure), Google (Chrome), Novell (SUSE Linux), Canonical (Ubuntu) etc. to sponser [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/membership/members/) and other commmunity-driven Linux projects like [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/), [KDE](https://kde.org/donations) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/partners/). There even exists open source testbeds for commercial products like [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/sponsors/) for RHEL and [openSUSE](https://en.opensuse.org/Sponsors) for SUSE. However, there are still many popular Linux related projects which lack significant corporate backing, like [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/donate/), [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/sponsors.php) and [Xfce](https://simon.shimmerproject.org/2020/06/18/why-bountysource-why/). Among the non-corporate porjects, only Linux Mint seems to be making decent progress by focusing solely on the development of [Cinnamon desktop enviroment](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/) and relying on Ubuntu/Debain for the core components.
