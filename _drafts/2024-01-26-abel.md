In this seminar, I discussed some interesting things I learned while preparing for my [comprehensive exam](https://gkorpal.github.io/technical/2023-12-07-deuring-correspondence). 

The focus was on the analytic theory of curves we encounter in number theory, closely related to my lecture on the [Poncelet Closure Theorem](https://gkorpal.github.io/lecture/2017-03-18-poncelet). Niels Abel, who died of tuberculosis at 26 in 1829, was the hero of my talk. In 1824, Abel sent a paper on the unsolvability of the quintic equation to Gauss, who proceeded to discard without a glance what he believed to be the worthless work of a crank. Later, in 1825, Abel traveled to Paris, where he presented his paper revealing the double periodicity of the elliptic functions. However, Cauchy proceeded to misplace the manuscript. Finally, two days after his death, a letter from Crelle arrived informing him that he had been offered a professorship at the University of Berlin. :/

### Abelian variety

Abelian integral: https://rdcu.be/dwJAN 

A complex abelian variety is a smooth projective variety which happens to be a complex torus. This simplifies many things compared to general varieties, but it also means that one can ask harder questions. Abelian varieties are indeed abelian groups (unlike elliptic curves which aren’t ellipses), however the use “abelian” here comes about from the connection with abelian integrals which generalize elliptic integrals.

### Jacobian Variety

Over C the Abel-Jacobi map shows that the Jacobian of X is intimately related to the study of abelian integrals. Historically that was the prime motivation to study Jacobians. A fun fact is that modular functions coming from hyperelliptic integrals can be used to solve algebraic equations. 
https://mathoverflow.net/a/365039/

The Jacobian is a group, and in fact an abelian variety, whereas the curve usually isn't. This gives you a lot of structure to play with that you didn't have initially.

Curves and their Jacobians (Lecture 3): https://wstein.org/edu/Fall2003/252/references/mumford-jacobians/

Geometrically, these group laws come from "generalized Jacobians".

### Hyperelliptic curve

Hyperelliptic curve over C: https://www.math.purdue.edu/~arapura/graph/hyper.html

In general: https://www.math.purdue.edu/~arapura/graph/algcurve.html

One way to get two dimensional abelian varieties is as Jacobians of genus two curves.
Example 1.5.3: https://wstein.org/edu/Fall2003/252/lectures/10-15-03/10-15-03-lecture.pdf

 X_0(23) is a hyperelliptic curve: https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~schoof/schoof_level23_latex.pdf

However, for genus 2 curves we can't have a non-singular model in the complex projective plane. Therefore, we generally use a plane hyperelliptic equation which represents the image of a projection X_0(23) with a single singularity at infinity.

https://sagecell.sagemath.org/
`````python
R.<x> = QQ[] #polynomial ring
H = HyperellipticCurve(x^6 - 8*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 2*x^3 - 11*x^2 + 10*x - 7)

from sage.schemes.curves.projective_curve import ProjectivePlaneCurve
ProjectivePlaneCurve.is_singular(H)

from sage.schemes.curves.affine_curve import AffineCurve
AffineCurve.is_singular(H.affine_patch(2))

plot(H) #affine plot over real numbers instead of rationals
`````
