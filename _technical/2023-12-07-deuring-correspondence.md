Work done between Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 (October 17, 2022 to December 07, 2023).

Here are the report and presentation from my comprehensive exam about the connection between Deuring correspondence and isogeny-based signature schemes.

I plan to eventually improve the readability of the report (increase font size/line spacing, rearrange paragraphs, and add the index of examples/equations/figures). In the meantime, I invite readers to submit their comments (related to exposition, bibliography, typos,...).
