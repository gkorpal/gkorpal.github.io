Work done during between Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 (October 17, 2022 to December 07, 2023).

The Deuring correspondence plays an important role in the isogeny-based signature scheme called SQIsign. Here are the report and presentation for my comprehensive exam about this connection. 

In its current state, the report is not very welcoming to read (small font size/line spacing, long paragraphs, missing index of examples/equations/figures). I plan to eventually improve its readability. In the mean time, I invite readers to submit their comments (exposition, bibliography, typos,...).
