Work done between Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 (October 17, 2022 to December 07, 2023).

The Deuring correspondence plays an important role in the isogeny-based signature scheme called SQIsign. Here are the report and presentation from my comprehensive exam about this connection. 

I plan to eventually improve readability of the report (increase font size/line spacing, rearrange paragraphs, add index of examples/equations/figures).  In the mean time, I invite readers to submit their comments (related to exposition, bibliography, typos,...).
