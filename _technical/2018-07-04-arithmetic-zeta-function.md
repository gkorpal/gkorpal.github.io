Work done during summer 2018 (June 04, 2018 to July 04, 2018).

The generalized definition of zeta-function for higher dimensional varieties was studied, following the lecture notes by Prof. Bas Edixhoven and Prof. Lenny Taelman. I also learned the application of Weil conjectures for counting points on smooth projective curves over finite fields by following a few expository articles.
