Work done during spring 2019 (January 01, 2019 to April 19, 2019).

The report begins with an introduction to the theory of complex manifolds. Then a proof of Dolbeault theorem, analogous to that of de Rham theorem, was studied. The utility of Dolbeault-ÄŒech isomorphism is illustrated by proving that every analytic hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}^n$ can be described as the zero-locus of an entire function.
