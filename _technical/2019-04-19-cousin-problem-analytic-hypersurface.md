Work done during spring 2019 (January 01, 2019 to April 19, 2019). Requirement for NISER's course M599.

Firstly, a proof of Dolbeault theorem was studied. Then the utility of Dolbeault-ÄŒech isomorphism was illustrated by proving that every analytic hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}^n$ can be described as the zero-locus of an entire function.
