Work done during winter 2017 (December 08, 2017 to December 30, 2017).

Learned the basics of classical one-variable theory of modular forms following Koblitz's book "Introduction to Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms".  The concepts like  $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and its congruence subgroups, modular forms for $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, modular forms for congruence subgroups, Eisenstein series, zeros and poles of modular functions, dimensions of the spaces of modular forms, and $j$-invariant L-function associated to modular forms were studied.
