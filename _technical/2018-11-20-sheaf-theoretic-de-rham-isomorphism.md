Work done during fall 2018 (August 01, 2018 to November 20, 2018). Requirement for NISER's course M598.

Studied a sheaf-theoretic proof of de Rham cohomology being a topological invariant. The de Rham cohomology of a smooth manifold was shown to be isomorphic to the ÄŒech cohomology of that manifold with real coefficients.
