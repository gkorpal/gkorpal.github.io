Cypherpunks write code ([*A Cypherpunk's Manifesto* - Eric Hughes, 1993](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)). Therefore, I want to work through various problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/). However, currently, I can't code proficiently in any language.

## The past
In the past, I have dabbled in programming using different languages:

| Education level | Programming language | IDE/Editor (Operating System) |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
|Primary school (classes I to IV) | Logo | MSWLogo (Windows 98)|
|Middle school (classes V to VIII) | [Small Basic](https://github.com/gkorpal/DreamSpark-SmallBasic) | Microsoft Small Basic (Windows XP SP3)|
|High school (classes IX to XII) | [Swing (Java)/SQL](https://github.com/gkorpal/learning-Java_GUI) | NetBeans/MySQL (Windows 7)|
|Undergraduate school | [C++](https://github.com/gkorpal/learning-Cpp_OOP) |Code::Blocks (Ubuntu 14.04)|

Unfortunately, I never spent time honing my programming skills. Therefore, at the beginning of my graduate school, I thought of properly learning [programming in Python](https://gkorpal.github.io/posts/2021/01/higher-arithmetic-computations/). However, most of the [study materials](https://github.com/gkorpal/learning-Python_maths) I found were more about "writing code to solve data science problems" rather than "learning to solve problems using programming."

## The present

I spent one year learning the basics of computer science following the advice from UArizona Computer Science department students and professors. None of the textbooks were read cover to cover.

During this one-year journey, I got the opportunity to practice programming in different languages:

| Language | Programming Paradigm | GitHub |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| C        | Procedural | [Software Router](https://github.com/gkorpal/SoftwareRouter) and [TLS VPN](https://github.com/gkorpal/TLS-VPN)|
| Racket   | Functional | [Beginning Student Language](https://github.com/gkorpal/HtDP)|
| Python  | Object-Oriented | [Jack VM](https://github.com/gkorpal/Nand2Tetris)|

I also learned regular expression usage in AWK ([Frequency Analysis](https://github.com/gkorpal/TLS-VPN/tree/master/practice/secret-key_encryption)) and Python ([Lexical Analysis](https://github.com/gkorpal/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/p10p11)).

## The future
Next, I would like to improve my programming skills by 
- using Python to solve the exercises from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), [id0-rsa](https://id0-rsa.pub/), [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/), [CrytoHack](https://cryptohack.org/), and other [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/);
- using C++ to solve competitive programming problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and popular online judges (eg. [UVa](https://onlinejudge.org/), [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [Sphere](https://www.spoj.com/), [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/), [Timus](https://acm.timus.ru/), [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/), [Marisa](https://marisaoj.com/), ...);
- contributing to [Open Source projects](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/), especially [SageMath](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-contribute.html);

However, there are [many more programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages) to choose from. For example, the following are some of the main programming languages developed before the Internet age (source: *Programming Languages - Principles and Practice, by Louden & Lambert, 3rd ed*)

Eventually, I would also like to learn Rust and contribute to [modern computer security projects](https://cryptography.rs/).

<!---- 
and participate in [Capture The Flag (CTF)](https://ctftime.org/) competitions like , [RootMe](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) (Kali Linux).
