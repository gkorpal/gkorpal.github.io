Following are some of the articles that I found to be very useful. Note that the order of authors' names in mathematics and (computer) science articles tend to have different meaning, for details see [this paper by Andrew Appel](https://doi.org/10.1145/131080.131091) and [this statement by the American Mathematical Society](http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/CultureStatement04.pdf).
