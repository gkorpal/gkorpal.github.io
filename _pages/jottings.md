**Kerckhoffs's principle:** *A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.*

### Computationally secure cryptography

I would recommend reading Seny Kamara's blog post about [getting started in cryptography](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/blog/how-not-to-learn-cryptography/).

- [Pencil-paper safe cryptography](https://gkorpal.github.io/pencil)
- [Computer safe cryptography](https://gkorpal.github.io/computer)
- [Quantum safe cryptography](https://gkorpal.github.io/quantum)

### Unconditionally secure cryptography
