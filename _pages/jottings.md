<!----- **Kerckhoffs's principle:** *A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.*----->

To get started, I would recommend reading the following blog posts about:
* [So, You Want to be a Cryptographer](https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1999/1015.html#SoYouWanttobeaCryptographer) - Bruce Schneier (Oct 1999)
* [How Not to Learn Cryptography](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/blog/how-not-to-learn-cryptography/) - Seny Kamara (Nov 2014)
* [Cryptography and Mathematics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2730916) - Kristin Lauter's interview in XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students (Mar 2015)

Also to get some sense of the breadth of this field, one can look at Vipul Goyal's CMU course [Introduction to Cryptography](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/15356/) from Fall 2020. (direct links: [videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI3cKEs5b6gvelkJnHf16r3ADhYvcQjdr) and [notes](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/15356/lecture_notes.pdf)).
