**Kerckhoffs's principle:** *A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.*

I would recommend reading Seny Kamara's blog post about [getting started in cryptography](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/blog/how-not-to-learn-cryptography/) and also look at Vipul Goyal's CMU course [Introduction to Cryptography](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/15356/) from Fall 2020. (direct links: [videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI3cKEs5b6gvelkJnHf16r3ADhYvcQjdr) and [notes](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/15356/lecture_notes.pdf)).
