## Computationally secure cryptography

<img align="right" width="343" height="210" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png">

These cryptosystems are considered secure against the computation power offered by humans with pencil-paper, computers, and quantum computers.

* ### [Classical computer safe cryptography](https://gkorpal.github.io/computer)
* ### [Quantum computer safe cryptography](https://gkorpal.github.io/quantum)

 **Kerckhoffs's principle:** *A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.*----->
