<!----- **Kerckhoffs's principle:** *A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.*----->

To get started, I would recommend reading the following blog posts/interviews:
* [So, You Want to be a Cryptographer](https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1999/1015.html#SoYouWanttobeaCryptographer) - Bruce Schneier (Oct 1999)
* [Applied Cryptography Engineering](https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2013/07/22/applied-practical-cryptography/) - Thomas and Erin Ptacek "Matasano" (Jul 2013)
* [How Not to Learn Cryptography](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/blog/how-not-to-learn-cryptography/) - Seny Kamara (Nov 2014)
* [Cryptography and Mathematics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2730916) - Kristin Lauter's interview in XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students (Mar 2015)
* [How I became a cryptographer](https://littlemaninmyhead.wordpress.com/2017/05/18/how-i-became-a-cryptographer/) and [why I left cryptography](https://littlemaninmyhead.wordpress.com/2017/10/23/why-i-left-cryptography/) - Scott Contini (May-Oct 2017)
* [How to become a Security Engineer](https://www.coryhardman.com/2021/05/how-to-become-security-engineer.html) - Cory Hardman (May 2021)

To get some sense of the breadth of this field, one can look at the following notes/resources:
* [The Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com/) - Mike Rosulek (Oregon State)
* [A Course in Cryptography](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4830/2010fa/lecnotes.pdf) - Rafael Pass and Abhi Shelat (Cornell)
* [Introduction to Cryptography](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/15356/lecture_notes.pdf) (direct links: [videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI3cKEs5b6gvelkJnHf16r3ADhYvcQjdr) and [course webpage](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/15356/)) - Vipul Goyal (Carnegie Mellon)
* [Useful Cryptography Resources](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/useful-cryptography-resources/) - Matthew Green (Johns Hopkins)

Finally, following are some of my *jottings*:
