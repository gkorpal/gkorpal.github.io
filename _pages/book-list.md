# Biographies and Autobiographies #
------

<img src="/images/book5.jpg" alt="">

*[Here](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/old-olympiad.pdf) is an outdated list of olympiad preparation books.*

# High School Maths #
------

<img src="/images/book3.jpg" alt="">

The High School constitutes of class IX-XII (Secondary and Senior Secondary education in India), i.e. students aged 14 to 18.

* **NCERT textbooks**: These books were written before 2005. They still follow the old notation to represent natural numbers, integers etc., for example: using  <b>N </b> instead of <b>ℕ </b> to represent set of natural numbers.  Since, only after 2003, bold font (like <b>N</b>)  was completely replaced by  blackboard bold font (like <b>ℕ</b> ) to represent some familiar systems of numbers (like "set of natural numbers") in print.  All of these can be downloaded legally from [NCERT e-books website](http://ncert.nic.in/textbook/textbook.htm).
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class IX [NCF – 2005]* is fantastic book as it touches nearly all topics (like geometry, polynomials, Number Theory (rational - irrational numbers), Introduction to mathematical modelling).FOR EXAMPLE: I was spell bound by chapter - “Introduction to Euclid’s Axioms” and I ended up reading “<i>Euclid’s Window by Leonard Mlodinow</i> “ & “<i>Fun & Fundamentals of Mathematics by Narlikar</i>”
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class X [NCF – 2005]* also consists of basics of “Number Theory” topics like “Euclid’s division algorithm”. Moreover the appendices on “Proofs in Mathematics” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading even at later stages. FOR EXAMPLE: The discussion on ‘Proof by Contradiction’ is awesome.
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class XI [NCF – 2005]* includes some of most fundamental mathematics concepts like “Set Theory”, “Principle of Mathematical Induction”, “Summation of Series”, “Binomial Theorem” & “Permutation & Combinations”. Also appendices on “Infinite Series” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading.</li>
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class XII [NCF – 2005]* major focus in on Calculus, but still its appendices on “Proofs in Mathematics” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading. FOR EXAMPLE: In Appendix – 1 (Proofs in Mathematics), there are proofs for two beautiful theorems of Number theory (a) Prime Numbers are infinite & (b) Fermat Numbers are NOT Prime
* **MATH!: Encounters with High School Students** by *Serge Lang*: A collection of conversations involving high-school geometry.
* **Higher Algebra** by *Barnard and Child*: A classic book in college algebra and discrete-maths, contains my favourite proof of Wilson's theorem. Freely available on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/higheralgebra032813mbp/page/n4).
* **The Cartoon Guide to Calculus** by *Larry Gonick*:  A Fantastic book ! Everyone will love calculus after reading this. An illustrative guide to elementary calculus.
* **Calculus: Basic Concepts for High Schools** by *Lev Tarasov*: Among the many calculus textbooks I read, this was the one which gave me the most clarity. Re-written in [LaTeX](https://archive.org/details/LevTarasovCalculusBasicConceptsForHighSchools/page/n101) by [The Mitr](https://wp.me/p13GRc-RX).

# Undergraduate Maths #
-----

<img src="/images/book4.jpg" alt="">

The Undergraduate constitutes of 4-year bachelor's degree program in mathematics (Tertiary education in India), i.e. students aged 18 to 22.

## Basics ##

* **Calculus I, II, III** by *Jerrold E. Marsden and Alan Weinstein*:  These books are old fashioned version of Calculus I, II and II (US Education System). The books are available <a href="https://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/marsden-weinstein/" target="_blank">here</a>. This topic is an amalgamation of analysis, topology and geometry. We use geometric and topological properties of the Euclidean space to find some logic behind analytic facts about functions defined on Euclidean space. This is the "maths" needed for most of the undergraduate Physics courses.
* **Linear Algebra** by *Friedberg, Insel and Spence*: To avoid typos, use 1999 reprint of the third edition, or more recent editions. It is a good book to learn basic stuff used in algebra (modules over PID, representation of finite groups, etc.), analysis (Banach space, numerical analysis, differential equations, etc.),  geometry (coordinate change, orientation, multilinear maps, etc.) and discrete mathematics (incidence matrix etc.). 

## Algebra ##

* **Abstract Algebra** by *Dummit and Foote*: For an introduction to group theory, ring theory, modules over PID, field theory and Galois theory (answers to straight edge & compass construction questions we encountered in high-school). Has lots of solved examples. Beginners might find the books by Fraleigh (A First Course in Abstract Algebra) and Gallian (Contemporary Abstract Algebra) more useful for learning basic group theory. 
* **Introduction to Commutative Algebra** by *Atiyah and MacDonald*: For those who want to learn commutative algebra for algebraic geometry. Really helpful for someone planning to read Hartshorne's book "Algebraic Geometry". For a more gentle introduction, read the book by N. S. Gopala Krishnan.
* **Representation Theory of Finite Groups** by *Martin Burrow*: Must read the introduction to the first chapter. Notations are a bit outdated, but not as [bad](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/192728) as in Gordon James and Martin Liebeck's book "Representation and Characters of Groups". 

## Analysis ##

* **Foundations of Analysis** by *E. Landau*: Fantastic short book. I learned about Peano axioms from this book. Terry Tao's book "Analysis I" also starts with a similar discussion.
* **Introduction to Real Analysis** by *Bartle and Sherbert*: A very nice introduction to concepts like countability and epsilon-delta method for functions defined over $\mathbb{R}$. Focus is to rigorously prove the stuff learned in Calculus I and II. Lots of examples and good exercises. Also compares improper Riemann integration with Lebesgue integration (pros and cons).
* **Topology of Metric Spaces** by *S. Kumaresan*: Discusses various useful inequalitites needed in analysis and helps us see the importance of metric space structure of $\mathbb{R}^n$ in real analysis. Also have a look at the book "The Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class" by J. Michael Steele.
* **Lebesgue Integration On Euclidean Space** by *Frank Jones*: An introductory text on mesaure theory and fourier analysis over $\mathbb{R}^n$. We learn that Lebesgue measure space is the completion of the Borel measure space and the space of Lebesgue integrable functions is the completion of the space of Riemann integrable functions. If you find this book boring/easy, spend some time on the first three chapters of Folland's book "Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications".
* **Complex Analysis** by *Bak and Newman*: A comprehensive introduction to analysis of functions defined over $\mathbb{C}$. We study things like holomorphic functions (Fundamental theorem of Algebra), contour integration (Residue theorem), Mobius tranformation etc. This book also contains a brand new proof of prime number theorem. For a more gentle introduction, see the book by Sasane and Sasane, "A Friendly Approach to Complex Analysis" or the book by Brown and Churchill, "Complex Variables and Applications".
* **Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis** by *G. F. Simmons*: This book should be renamed as "An Introduction to Functional Analysis". Here we talk about normed linear spaces over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$.
* **Differential Equations** by *S. L. Ross*: Nothing special, any other text like Simmons and Krantz's book "Differential Equations: Theory, Technique and Practice" is also good. We will see the proofs of facts learned in Calculus II.

*I never came across a good introductory book on numerical analysis. In general, you can pick some notes which use GNU Octave or Python for implementing the algorithms.*

## Topology ##

* **Topology** by *James Munkres*: For point-set topology and introductory algebraic topology (fundamental groups). The focus is on generalizing the properties of continuous funtions learned in Calculus I and III.
* **An Introduction to Algebraic Topology** by *Joseph Rotman*: A good introductory text with a good number of examples about homology. Can read Munkres' "Elements of Algebraic Topology" for a more detailed discussion about both homology and cohomology.
* **Differential Topology** by *Amiya Mukherjee*: This text nicely complements the study of smooth manifolds.

## Geometry ##

* **Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra And Differential Forms: A unified approach** by *J. H. Hubbard and B. B. Hubbard*: A visual introduction to manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Also discusses the geometry of curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Focus is to rigorously prove the stuff learned in Calculus III and extend those ideas. In real analysis we extend the scope of Riemann integration by using Lebesgue integration (complete normed linear space). However, as per Lebesgue integration, integration over a curve will be zero since a curve is of measure zero. Therefore, here we first mimic the usual Riemann integration for functions over higher dimensions, and then extend the scope using differential forms (like we used cross product in $\mathbb{R}^3$). But still, the theory of improper Riemann integrals over $\mathbb{R}^n$ is not as powerful as was in the case of functions over $\mathbb{R}$ (improper Riemann integral is more powerful than Legesgue integration over $\mathbb{R}$). 
* **Analysis on Manifolds** by *J. Munkres*: A rigorous introduction to manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (de Rham cohomology). He provides better notations for differentaition and integration, hence clearing the confusion caused due to Calculus notations like "dx" etc. 
* **An Introduction to Manifolds** by *Loring  W. Tu*: The best possible introduction to smooth manifolds (de Rham cohomology). Can skip the Lie group, Lie algebra and Lie derivative during the first reading. 
* **Projective Geometry** by *Pierre Samuel* (translated from French by Silvio Levy): It is such a pity that there is no proper course to bridge the gap between high-school geometry (Euclidean plane, Cartesian 2D and 3D, and Argand plane) and university geometry (differential geometry and algebraic geometry). However, just like Hubbard & Hubbard's book attempts to bridge the gap between high-school geometry and differential geometry, this book offers a chance to bridge the gap between high-school geometry and algebraic geometry. The book is available on <a href="https://archive.org/details/projectivegeomet0000samu" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>. A good follow-up read would be either the book "Algebraic Curves" by Fulton ([available online](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf)) for those who want to dig deeper into algebraic geometry concepts (Riemann-Roch theorem) or the book "An Introduction to Incidence Geometry" by Bart De Bruyn for those who want to dig deeper into discrete mathematics stuff. Also, keep in mind that "projective space" we encounter in algebraic topology/differential geometry and projective geometry/algebraic geometry is different because of the underlying topology ([discussion](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/2826053/)).
* **An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry** by *Karen E. Smith, Lauri Kahanpää, Pekka Kekäläinen, and William Traves*: This book nicely complements the first chapter of Hartshorne (rest of that book is about scheme theory). Lots of solved examples. You can also have a look at the book "Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry" by Miles Reid which is a good sequel to the author's book "Undergraduate commutative algebra".

## Discrete Mathematics ##

* **Introductory Combinatorics** by *R. A. Brualdi*: There are some typos, but there some really interesting discussions like an interesting theorem by Erdős and Szekeres (pp. 76, 5th ed).
* **An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers** by *Ivan Niven, Herbert S. Zuckerman and Hugh L. Montgomery*: Covers all flavours of number theory in adequate detail. For a more gentle introduction, see Silverman's book "A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory".

*I never came across a good introductory book on graph theory. In general, you can pick some notes which use C++ or Python for implementing the algorithms.*

# Special Interests #
--------------

<img src="/images/book6.jpg" alt="">

## Elementary Number Theory ##

* **An Introduction to Diophantine Equations** by *Dorin Andrica, Ion Cucurezeanu, and Titu Andreescu*: A really nice place to learn elementary methods for solving various types of Diophantine equations.
* **A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory** by *Joseph H. Silverman*: A modern introduction to elementary number theory.
* **The  Higher  Arithmetic** by *Harold  Davenport*: It is written in prose form, many interesting things to learn.

## Transcendental Number Theory ##

* **Topics in Number Theory (Volumes I and II)** by *William J. LeVeque*: The best place to understand the proof of Roth's theorem and Delaunay-Nagell theorem (discussed in the volume 2 part). The volume 1 part can also be used as an introduction to elementary number theory. If you want to see the proof of Roth's theorem in terms of exercises, have a look at the book "An Invitation to Modern Number Theory" by Steven J. Miller and Ramin Takloo-Bighash.
* **Diophantine Approximation** by *W. M. Schmidt*: Standard reference for the general theory. Also contains proofs of theorems belonging to "Geometry of Numbers".
* **Making Transcendence Transparent** by *E.B. Burger and R. Tubbs*: Very nice introductory text for learning the techniques used in transcedental number theory.

## Analytic Number Theory ##

* **Multiplicative Number Theory** by *Harold Davenport*: This is a tough book for introducing analytic number theory, but worth the hardwork since the proof of Prime Number Theorem with a good extimate has been discussed. However, anyone interested in analytic number theory must read the chapter 8 about Riemann's contribution (he wrote only one paper!). Also, for a straighforward proof of Dirichlet's theorem on infinite primes arithmetic progressions see the chapter 16 of the book "A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory" by Kenneth Ireland and Michael Rosen.
* **An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers** by *G. H. Hardy* and *E. M. Wright*: It is a classic textbook with lot of interesting stuff using elementary analytic methods. 
* **Elementary Methods in Number Theory** by *M. B. Nathanson*: The part 3 of this book gives a good introduction to additive aspects of analytic number theory. I haven't spent much time on this book since I don't enjoy analysis in general.
* **Introduction to Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms** by *Neal Koblitz*: A great introduction to modular forms, which basically adds details and exercises to Serre's condense one chapter introduction in his classic book "A Course in Arithmetic". The study of modular forms is motivated via congruent number problem, and a brief discussion of analytic theory of elliptic curves.

## Algebraic Number Theory ##

* **Number Fields** by *Daniel Marcus*: The best introductory text on algeraic number theory, where most big proofs are in the form of exercises. When I read this book in 2016, it was available only in old typewriter font but fortunately in 2018 Springer released its LaTeX edition! Also, have a look at the books: (1) "Algebraic Theory of Numbers" by Pierre Samuel, and (2) "Algebraic number theory and Fermat's last theorem" by Ian Stewart and David Tall. 
* **Algebraic Number Theory** by *Jürgen Neukirch* (translated from German by Norbert Schappacher): A really nice second introduction to algebraic number theory for someone interested in arithmetic geometry. This book nicely interlaces algebraic geometry with algebraic number theory. It serves the purpose of standard reference. I have read parts of Chapter I, II and VII.
* **Class Field Theory** by *J.S. Milne*: Standard textbook ([available online](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/cft.html)). I haven't read it properly.

## Complex Geometry ##

* **Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces** by *Rick Miranda*: Chapter IX for the definiton and basic properties of Cech cohomology.
  * **Functions of One Complex Variable** by *J. B. Conway*: I really like the proofs given in this book (Runge's theorem, Mittag-Leffler's theorem and Weierstrass factorization theorem) which are critical for understanding Riemann surfaces.
* **From Holomorphic Functions to Complex Manifolds** by *Fritzsche and Grauert*: For analytic subvariety properties.
  * **Analytic Functions of Several Complex Variables** by *Gunning and Rossi*: The necessary background about several variable complex valued functions, and a detailed proof of $\overline{\partial}$-Poincare lemma.
  * **Function Theory of Several Complex Variables** by *S. G. Krantz*: The proof of Dolbeault theorem for $\mathbb{C}^n$ is discussed in section 6.3.
  * **Differential Analysis on Complex Manifolds** by *R. O. Wells*: For understanding vector bundles and more.
* **Principles of Algebraic Geometry** by *Joe Harris and Phillip Griffiths*: The only available introductory text on complex algebraic geometry. Not at all a good book for self study, my whole master's thesis was an attempt to understand 14 pages of this book (pp. 34-47). However, trying to understand the given collection of ideas is worth the effort.
  * **Complex Geometry** by *Daniel Huybrechts*: The first two chapters of this book cover the necessary complex analysis and complex manifolds background needed for Griffiths-Harris. Especially the proof of $\overline{\partial}$-Poincare lemma. The proof of Poincare lemma can be found in Munkres' "Analysis on Manifolds".
  * **Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups** by *W. F. Warner*: Chapter 5 where the equivalence of Cech cohomology to sheaf cohomology is discussed.
  * **Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry** by *Friedrich Hirzebruch*: Section 2 for the relation between Cech and de Rham cohomology.
  
## Enumerative Geometry ##

* **Enumerative Geometry and String Theory** by *Sheldon Katz*: Standard introductory text. Can be supplemented with the articles: (1) "Enumerative Algebraic Geometry of Conics" by Bashelor, Ksir, and Traves ([MAA](https://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/enumerative-algebraic-geometry-of-conics)), (2) "Introduction to Moduli Spaces: A cycle of lectures at Universidad de Costa Rica" by Renzo Cavalieri ([combined pdf](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/Introduction-to-Moduli-Spaces.pdf))
* **Mirror Symmetry and Algebraic Geometry** by *David A. Cox and Sheldon Katz*: Standard reference for learning about Gromov-Witten Invariants (chapter 7). Not an easy read. 
  * **Algebraic Geometry** by *A. Gathmann*: A gentle introduction to algebraic geometry with lots of computational exercises oriented towards the useful "intersection theory". There are many editions available, but I have read only the [2002 edition](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmann/class/alggeom-2002/alggeom-2002.pdf).
  * **Mirror symmetry** by *Hori, et. al.*: For a more gentle introduction to Gromov-Witten Invariants, try reading Chapter 21 to 23 of this book.
* **An Invitation to Quantum Cohomology: Kontsevich's Formula for Rational Plane Curves** by *Kock and Vainsencher*: A good place to learn teachiniques involved in calculations (haven't read it myself). You can supplement it with the article "Counting Plane Rational Curves: Old and New Approaches" by Aleksey Zinger ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0507105)) and the Ph.D. thesis "Gromov-Witten and degeneration invariants: computation and enumerative significance" by Andreas Gathmann.

## Arithmetic Geometry ##

* **Rational Points on Elliptic Curves** by *J. H. Silverman and John Tate*: One of the most accessible introduction to the world of elliptic curves. I read the chapters I to III of this book a while ago for Mordell’s theorem (the special case of elliptic curves with a rational point of order two). The appendix on projective geometry is also great. 
* **The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves** by *J. H. Silverman*: The standard text introductory text about elliptic curves using techniques from algebraic geometry (varieties in projective spaces). Make sure to buy the 2nd edition corrected in 2016 printing, since earlier versions have lot of typos.
   * **Basic Algebraic Geometry** by *Igor Shafarevich* (translated from Russian by K. A. Hirsch): This is a reference for many proofs skipped in the first two chapters by Silverman. Note that this is quiet different, in terms of notations and organization, from the newer expanded translation by Miles Reid.
* **Abelian Varieties** by *David Mumford*: To read list.
  * **Algebraic Geometry** by *Hartshorne*: This standard text introducing algebraic geometry via the theory of schemes. Also, the book "The Geometry of Schemes" by Eisenbud and Harris acts as a bridge between the first chapter and rest of the chapters of Hartshorne.
