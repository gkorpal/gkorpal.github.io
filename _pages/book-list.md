## High-school maths ##
------

<img src="/images/book3.jpg" alt="">

* **NCERT textbooks**: These books were written before 2005. They still follow the old notation to represent natural numbers, integers etc., for example: using  <b>N </b> instead of <b>ℕ </b> to represent set of natural numbers.  Since, only after 2003, bold font (like <b>N</b>)  was completely replaced by  blackboard bold font (like <b>ℕ</b> ) to represent some familiar systems of numbers (like "set of natural numbers") in print.  All of these can be downloaded legally from [NCERT e-books website](http://ncert.nic.in/textbook/textbook.htm).
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class IX [NCF – 2005]* is fantastic book as it touches nearly all topics (like geometry, polynomials, Number Theory (rational - irrational numbers), Introduction to mathematical modelling).FOR EXAMPLE: I was spell bound by chapter - “Introduction to Euclid’s Axioms” and I ended up reading “<i>Euclid’s Window by Leonard Mlodinow</i> “ & “<i>Fun & Fundamentals of Mathematics by Narlikar</i>”
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class X [NCF – 2005]* also consists of basics of “Number Theory” topics like “Euclid’s division algorithm”. Moreover the appendices on “Proofs in Mathematics” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading even at later stages. FOR EXAMPLE: The discussion on ‘Proof by Contradiction’ is awesome.
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class XI [NCF – 2005]* includes some of most fundamental mathematics concepts like “Set Theory”, “Principle of Mathematical Induction”, “Summation of Series”, “Binomial Theorem” & “Permutation & Combinations”. Also appendices on “Infinite Series” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading.</li>
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class XII [NCF – 2005]* major focus in on Calculus, but still its appendices on “Proofs in Mathematics” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading. FOR EXAMPLE: In Appendix – 1 (Proofs in Mathematics), there are proofs for two beautiful theorems of Number theory (a) Prime Numbers are infinite & (b) Fermat Numbers are NOT Prime
* **Little Mathematics Library** by *MIR Publishers*: These books include short introductory material (without much detail) on various topics which can help student to get an idea of different fields of mathematics, written especially for high school students preparing for Olympiad. All of these can be downloaded legally from [mirtitles.org](http://mirtitles.org/2012/09/06/little-mathematics-library-taking-stock/).
* **Fun and Fundamentals of Mathematics** by *J. V. Narlikar and M. Narlikar*: This was the first book I bought through flipkart (when it had just started as book selling website). Have read it many times, and enjoyed it every time.
* **A Mathematical Mosaic: Patterns & Problem-Solving** by *Ravi Vakil*: One of my favorite book (but sadly not available in India, bought it from the USA).
* **The Number Devil** by *Hans Magnus Enzensberge*: Though the author is not a mathematician, he is a well-known and respected European intellectual and author with wide-ranging interests. This book is similar to George Gamow’s "Mr Tompkins". Plus it's a colourful maths book!
* **Challenge and Thrill of Pre-College Mathematics** by *Krishnamurthy, Pranesachar,Ranganathan and Venkatachala*: I learned geometry and combinatorics from this book, was fascinated by the Friendship theorem and the work of Erdos.

* **Hands-on Geometry** by *Christopher M. Freeman*: Lovely book ! A step-by-step  guide to learning constructions
* **Higher Algebra** by *Barnard and Child*: A classic book in college algebra, contains my favourite proof of Wilson's theorem. Freely available on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/higheralgebra032813mbp/page/n4).
* **The Cartoon Guide to Calculus** by *Larry Gonick*:  A Fantastic book ! Everyone will love calculus after reading this. An illustrative guide to elementary calculus.
* **Calculus: Basic Concepts for High Schools** by *Lev Tarasov*: Among the many calculus textbooks I read, this was the one which gave me the most clarity. Re-written in [LaTeX](https://archive.org/details/LevTarasovCalculusBasicConceptsForHighSchools/page/n101) by [The Mitr](https://wp.me/p13GRc-RX).
* **Mathematics: A very Short Introduction** by *T. Gowers*: A broad overview of research carrier in mathematics.

* **Mathematical Circles (Russian Experience)** by *Fomin, Genkin, and Itenberg* : A thought provoking book for students of class VIII & IX
* **Non-Routine Problems in Mathematics** by *AMTI (Editor: V. K. Krishnan)* : Lovely book but has few wrong solutions for problems posed in exercises
* **Problem-Solving Strategies** by *Arthur Engel*: This book is more than enough for someone preparing for olympiads. I found the problems in this book to be quite hard but satisfying.
* **The Art and Craft of Problem Solving** by *Paul Zeitz*: The first four chapters of this book taught me how to streamline my thinking process.

*[Here](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/old-olympiad.pdf) is an outdated list of olympiad preparation books.*

## Popular maths and Fiction ##
------

<img src="/images/book2.jpg" alt="">

* **Euclid’s Window** by *Leonard Mlodinow*: I loved reading this book (Mlodinow has co-authored "The Grand Design" by Stephen Hawking).
* **Fermat’s Last Theorem** by *Simon Singh*: A very detailed account on Fermat's Theorem with a good number of references.
* **The Poincare Conjecture** by *Donal O'Shea*: It was nice to see how the different branches of topology were developed to solve this conjecture.
* **The Einstein Theory of Relativity** by *Lillian R. Lieber*: A very clear exposition of the mathematical contribution of Albert Einstein.
* **Journey Through Genius** by *William Dunham*: Wonderful discussions about mathematical works of great mathematicians.
* **The Book of Numbers** by *John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy*: Clear explaination of complicated concepts, especially Bernoulli numbers and cardinal numbers (counting cards). Plus it's a colourful maths book!
* **Magical Mathematics** by *Persi Diaconis and Ron Graham*: Very interesting mathematical card tricks, a great treat for people who love the collection of Scientific American articles by Martin Gardner.
* **The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry** by *David Wells*: My favourite entry is "pursuit curves".
* **Flatland** by *Abbott*: It's a short and sweet book.
* **The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time** by *Mark Haddon*: An autistic boy who loves prime numbers.
* **The Devotion of Suspect X** by *Keigo Higashino*: The protagonist is a brilliant but lonely mathematician.

## Biographies and Autobiographies ##
------

<img src="/images/book5.jpg" alt="">

* **Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!** by *Richard Feynman*: MUST READ! It change my prospective of life, science and maths. Fun fact: Feynman was a [Putnam fellow](https://mks.mff.cuni.cz/kalva/putnam/putn39.html) and he wrote the exam just for fun, like most of his research (fooling around).
* **The Man Who Knew Infinity** by *Robert Kanigel*: The finest biography of Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyenger.
* **The Man Who Loved Only Numbers** by *Paul Hoffmann*: The biography of Paul Erdos which motivated me to become a mathematician.
* **A Beautiful Mind** by *Sylvia Nasar*: This is the biography of John Nash, a mathematician whose personality is quite the opposite of mine.

## AS ##

* **Topology** by *J. Munkres*: For point-set topology and introductory algebraic topology (fundamental groups).
* **An Introduction to Algebraic Topology** by *Joseph Rotman*: A good introductory text with a good number of examples. Can read Munkres' "Elements of Algebraic Topology" for a more detailed discussion.
* **Foundations of Analysis** by *E. Landau*: Fantastic short book. I learned about Peano axioms from this book. Terry Tao's "Analysis I" also starts with a similar discussion.
* **Introduction to Real Analysis** by *Bartle and Sherbert*: A very nice introduction to epsilon-delta framework. Lots of examples and good exercises.
* **Topology of Metric Spaces** by *Kumaresan*: Discusses various useful inequalitites needed in analysis and helps us see the importance of metric space structure in real analysis.
* **Analysis on Manifolds** by *Munkres*: A very clear introduction to several variable calculus. Prepares you to start reading about smooth manifold from Tu's "An Introduction to Manifolds". For integrations examples, see books by Tom Apostol (Calculus vol. 1 and 2, and Mathematical Analysis).
* **Lebesgue Integration On Euclidean Space** by *Frank Jones*: An introductory text on mesaure theory. If you find this book boring, spend some time on the first three chapters of Folland's "Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications".
* **Functions of One Complex Variable** by *J. B. Conway*: I really like the proofs given in this book, though I feel that it is a tough book for beginners. There are many better books in the market like the one by Bak and Newman, or Sasane and Sasane.
* **Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis** by *G. F. Simmons*: This book should be renamed as "An Introduction to Functional Analysis".
* **Differential Equations** by *S. L. Ross*: Nothing special, any other text like Simmons and Krantz's "Differential Equations: Theory - Technique and Practice" is also good.
* **Introductory Combinatorics** by *R. A. Brualdi*: There are some typos, but there some really interesting discussions like an interesting theorem by Erdős and Szekeres (pp. 76, 5th ed).
* **Topics in Algebra** by *I. N. Herstein*: For an introduction to group theory. Especially for the three different proofs of Sylow's theorems. Also has a good selection of exercises.
* **Linear Algebra** by *Hoffman and Kunze*: Surely there are better books in the market, but I learned from this. The first chapter is a bit of a mess with 4x4 and 5x5 matrices.
* **Abstract Algebra** by *Dummit and Foote*: For an introduction to ring theory, modules over PID, field theory and Galois theory. Has lots of solved examples.
* **Introduction to Commutative Algebra** by *Atiyah and MacDonald*: For those who want to learn commutative algebra for algebraic geometry. Really helpful for someone planning to read Hartshorne's "Algebraic Geometry". A more gentle introductory book is by N. S. Gopala Krishnan.
* **An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry** by *Karen E. Smith, Lauri Kahanpää, Pekka Kekäläinen, William Traves*: Really nice warmup book for Hartshorne.
* **An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers** by *Ivan Niven, Herbert S. Zuckerman and Hugh L. Montgomery*: Covers all flavours of number theory in adequate detail. For a more gentle introduction, see Silverman's "A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory".

*I don't know about a good introductory book on numerical analysis, graph theory, probability and statistics.*
