High-School Books
------
* These NCERT textbooks were written before 2005, they still follow the old notation to represent natural numbers, integers etc., for example: using  <b>N </b> instead of <b>ℕ </b> to represent set of natural numbers.  Since, only after 2003, bold font (like <b>N)</b>  was completely replaced by  blackboard bold font (like <b>ℕ</b> ) to represent some familiar systems of numbers (like "set of natural numbers") in print.
  * <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class IX [NCF – 2005]</b></span> is fantastic book as it touches nearly all topics (like geometry, polynomials, Number Theory (rational - irrational numbers), Introduction to mathematical modelling).FOR EXAMPLE: I was spell bound by chapter - “Introduction to Euclid’s Axioms” and I ended up reading “<i>Euclid’s Window by Leonard Mlodinow</i> “ & “<i>Fun & Fundamentals of Mathematics by Narlikar</i>”
  * <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class X [NCF – 2005]</span></b> also consists of basics of “Number Theory” topics like “Euclid’s division algorithm”. Moreover the appendices on “Proofs in Mathematics” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading even at later stages. FOR EXAMPLE: The discussion on ‘Proof by Contradiction’ is awesome.
  * <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class XI [NCF – 2005] </span></b>includes some of most fundamental mathematics concepts like “Set Theory”, “Principle of Mathematical Induction”, “Summation of Series”, “Binomial Theorem” & “Permutation & Combinations”. Also appendices on “Infinite Series” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading.</li>
  * <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class XII [NCF – 2005]</span></b> major focus in on Calculus, but still its appendices on “Proofs in Mathematics” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading. FOR EXAMPLE: In Appendix – 1 (Proofs in Mathematics), there are proofs for two beautiful theorems of Number theory (a) Prime Numbers are infinite & (b) Fermat Numbers are NOT Prime
* <b><u>Little Mathematics Library by MIR Publishers</u></b>: These books include short introductory material (without much detail) on various topics which can help student to get an idea of different fields of mathematics, written especially for high school students preparing for Olympiad. All these can be downloaded legally from [mirtitles.org](http://mirtitles.org/2012/09/06/little-mathematics-library-taking-stock/).
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Mathematical Circles (Russian Experience) by Fomin, Genkin, Itenberg</strong></span> : A thought provoking book for students of class VIII & IX
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>A Mathematical Mosaic: Patterns & Problem-Solving by Ravi Vakil</strong> </span>: My favorite book <em>(but sadly not available in India, bought it from USA)</em>
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Arithmetic and Algebra: Numbers and the beginnings of Algebra by Shirali</strong></span> : An ideal text for beginners
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>First Steps in Number Theory: A Primer on Divisibility by S.A. Shirali</strong></span> : Discusses congruences in good detail
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Hands-on Geometry by Christopher M. Freeman</strong></span>: Lovely book ! A step-by-step  guide to learning constructions
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Non-Routine Problems in Mathematics by AMTI (Editor: V. K. Krishnan)</strong></span> : Lovely book but has few wrong solutions for problems posed in exercises
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Cartoon Guide to Calculus by Larry Gonick</strong></span>:  A Fantastic book ! Everyone will love calculus after reading this. An illustrative guide to elementary calculus.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Mathematics: A very Short Introduction by T. Gowers</strong></span>: A broad overview of research carrier in mathematics.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>What is Mathematics ? by Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins</strong></span> : This is must read book for all students serious towards mathematics. This book will be your life long friend.</li>
