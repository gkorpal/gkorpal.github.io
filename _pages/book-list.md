Following are some of the mathematics books that I would recommend reading. The inspiration for this list came from the [Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography](https://github.com/ystael/chicago-ug-math-bib).

One might need university library membership to access some of the out-of-print books (or use the power of internet). I have arranged the books in the increasing order of difficulty with respect to the required mathematical maturity.

# Olympiad Maths 
--------

<img src="/images/book1.jpg" alt="">

These books should be accessible to the students in class VIII (final year of Primary education in India), i.e. children aged 13+.

* **Little Mathematics Library** by *MIR Publishers*: These books include short introductory material (without much detail) on various topics which can help student to get an idea of different fields of mathematics, written especially for high school students preparing for Olympiad.

*[Here](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/old-olympiad.pdf) is an outdated list of olympiad preparation books.*

# High School Maths 
------

<img src="/images/book3.jpg" alt="">

The High School constitutes of class IX-XII (Secondary and Senior Secondary education in India), i.e. students aged 14 to 18.

* **NCERT textbooks**: These books were written before 2005. They still follow the old notation to represent natural numbers, integers etc., for example: using  <b>N </b> instead of <b>ℕ </b> to represent set of natural numbers.  Since, only after 2003, bold font (like <b>N</b>)  was completely replaced by  blackboard bold font (like <b>ℕ</b> ) to represent some familiar systems of numbers (like "set of natural numbers") in print.  All of these can be downloaded legally from [NCERT e-books website](http://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php).
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class IX [NCF – 2005]* is fantastic book as it touches nearly all topics (like geometry, polynomials, Number Theory (rational - irrational numbers), Introduction to mathematical modelling).FOR EXAMPLE: I was spell bound by chapter - “Introduction to Euclid’s Axioms” and I ended up reading “<i>Euclid’s Window by Leonard Mlodinow</i> “ & “<i>Fun & Fundamentals of Mathematics by Narlikar</i>”
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class X [NCF – 2005]* also consists of basics of “Number Theory” topics like “Euclid’s division algorithm”. Moreover the appendices on “Proofs in Mathematics” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading even at later stages. FOR EXAMPLE: The discussion on ‘Proof by Contradiction’ is awesome.
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class XI [NCF – 2005]* includes some of most fundamental mathematics concepts like “Set Theory”, “Principle of Mathematical Induction”, “Summation of Series”, “Binomial Theorem” & “Permutation & Combinations”. Also appendices on “Infinite Series” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading.</li>
  * *NCERT Mathematics Textbook for Class XII [NCF – 2005]* major focus in on Calculus, but still its appendices on “Proofs in Mathematics” & “Mathematical Modelling” are worth reading. FOR EXAMPLE: In Appendix – 1 (Proofs in Mathematics), there are proofs for two beautiful theorems of Number theory (a) Prime Numbers are infinite & (b) Fermat Numbers are NOT Prime
* **MATH!: Encounters with High School Students** by *Serge Lang*: A collection of conversations involving high-school geometry.
* **Higher Algebra** by *Barnard and Child*: A classic book in college algebra and discrete-maths, contains my favourite proof of Wilson's theorem. Freely available on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/higheralgebra032813mbp/page/n4).
* **The Cartoon Guide to Calculus** by *Larry Gonick*:  A Fantastic book ! Everyone will love calculus after reading this. An illustrative guide to elementary calculus.
* **Calculus: Basic Concepts for High Schools** by *Lev Tarasov*: Among the many calculus textbooks I read, this was the one which gave me the most clarity. Re-written in [LaTeX](https://archive.org/details/LevTarasovCalculusBasicConceptsForHighSchools/page/n101) by [The Mitr](https://wp.me/p13GRc-RX).

# Undergraduate Maths 
-----

<img src="/images/book4.jpg" alt="">

The Undergraduate constitutes of 4-year bachelor's degree program in mathematics (Tertiary education in India), i.e. students aged 18 to 22. I have arranged the topics and books in the order of increasing requirement for mathematical maturity.

## Basics 

* **Calculus I, II, III** by *Jerrold E. Marsden and Alan Weinstein*:  These books are old fashioned version of Calculus I, II and II (US Education System). The books are available <a href="https://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/marsden-weinstein/" target="_blank">here</a> for free as part of the American Institute of Mathematics' [Open Textbook Initiative](https://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/). This topic is an amalgamation of analysis, topology and geometry. We use geometric and topological properties of the Euclidean space to find some logic behind analytic facts about functions defined on Euclidean space. This is the "maths" needed for most of the undergraduate Physics courses.
* **Linear Algebra** by *Friedberg, Insel and Spence*: To avoid typos, use 1999 reprint of the third edition, or more recent editions. It is a good book to learn basic stuff used in algebra (modules over PID, representation of finite groups, etc.), analysis (Banach space, numerical analysis, differential equations, etc.),  geometry (coordinate change, orientation, multilinear maps, etc.) and discrete mathematics (incidence matrix etc.). 
* **Introductory Combinatorics** by *R. A. Brualdi*: There are some typos, but there some really interesting discussions like an interesting theorem by Erdős and Szekeres (p. 76, 5th ed).
* **A First Course in Probability** by *S. Ross*: An elementary introduction to the theory of probability and its possible applications. After learning the basics, one can learn about stochastic process and the related applications like in [finance](https://quant.stackexchange.com/q/38862).
* **Mathematical Statistics with Applications in R** by *K.M. Ramachandran* and *C. Tsokos*: This is a very well written book for someone really new to statistics. After a bit of experience, one can move to the book by [N. Mukhopadhyay](https://www.routledge.com/Probability-and-Statistical-Inference/Mukhopadhyay/p/book/9780367659493) and then in the end to the book by [Rohatgi and Saleh](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/An+Introduction+to+Probability+and+Statistics%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9781118799642). *Recommended by TPR.*
* **A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory** by *J. H. Silverman*: A modern introduction to elementary number theory. There are many other similar books published by AMS and MAA.
* **A First Course in Graph Theory** (Dover edition) by *G. Chartrand* and *P. Zhang*: Good introductions to chapters, lots of examples and also has historical remarks in some places. *Recommended by SSH.*
* **Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python** by *B. M. Miller* and *D. L. Ranum*:  This is an introductory text on algorithms which uses Python 3.2 ([2nd edition](https://fbeedle.com/our-books/10-problem-solving-with-algorithms-and-data-structures-using-python-2nd-ed-9781590282571.html)) for illustrating concepts. This book is also [available online](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html), however you will need to use an adblocker or [host it yourself](https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/pythonds). Alternatively, one can use [the standard textbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) and use Python for solving exercises. <!---- I came to know about this book from the MIT OCW [Introduction to Algorithms](http://ocw.mit.edu/6-006F11)  ---->
* **Introduction to the Theory of Computation** by *M. Sipser*:  This is an introductory text on automata theory, computability theory, and complexity theory. 

## Algebra 

* **Abstract Algebra** by *Dummit and Foote*: For an introduction to group theory, ring theory, modules over PID, field theory and Galois theory (answers to straight edge & compass construction questions we encountered in high-school). Has lots of solved examples. Beginners might find the books by Fraleigh (A First Course in Abstract Algebra) and Gallian (Contemporary Abstract Algebra) more useful for learning basic group theory. 
* **Introduction to Commutative Algebra** by *Atiyah and MacDonald*: For those who want to learn commutative algebra for algebraic geometry. Really helpful for someone planning to read Hartshorne's book "Algebraic Geometry". For a more gentle introduction, you can read the book by N S Gopalakrishnan.

## Analysis 

* **Foundations of Analysis** by *E. Landau*: Fantastic short book. I learned about Peano axioms from this book. Terry Tao's book "Analysis I" also starts with a similar discussion.
* **Introduction to Real Analysis** by *Bartle and Sherbert*: A very nice introduction to concepts like countability and epsilon-delta method for functions defined over $\mathbb{R}$. Focus is to rigorously prove the stuff learned in Calculus I and II. Lots of examples and good exercises. Also compares improper Riemann integration with Lebesgue integration (pros and cons).
* **Topology of Metric Spaces** by *S. Kumaresan*: Discusses various useful inequalitites needed in analysis and helps us see the importance of metric space structure of $\mathbb{R}^n$ in real analysis. Also have a look at the book "The Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class" by J. Michael Steele.
* **Lebesgue Integration On Euclidean Space** by *Frank Jones*: An introductory text on mesaure theory and fourier analysis over $\mathbb{R}^n$. We learn that Lebesgue measure space is the completion of the Borel measure space and the space of Lebesgue integrable functions is the completion of the space of Riemann integrable functions. 
  * **Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications** by *Folland*: The first three chapters of this book complements the content of the above book.
* **Complex Analysis** by *Bak and Newman*: A comprehensive introduction to analysis of functions defined over $\mathbb{C}$. We study things like holomorphic functions (Fundamental theorem of Algebra), contour integration (Residue theorem), Mobius tranformation etc. This book also contains a brand new proof of prime number theorem. For a more gentle introduction, see the book by Sasane and Sasane, "A Friendly Approach to Complex Analysis" or the book by Brown and Churchill, "Complex Variables and Applications".
* **Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis** by *G. F. Simmons*: This book should be renamed as "An Introduction to Functional Analysis". Here we talk about normed linear spaces over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$.
* **Differential Equations** by *S. L. Ross*: Nothing special, any other text like Simmons and Krantz's book "Differential Equations: Theory, Technique and Practice" is also good. We will see the proofs of facts learned in Calculus II.
* **Tea Time Numerical Analysis** by *Leon Q. Brin*: An introductory textbook for numerical analysis with algortihms illustrated using GNU Octave. It is [available online](https://lqbrin.github.io/tea-time-numerical/) for free and is a part of the American Institute of Mathematics' [Open Textbook Initiative](https://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/).

## Topology 

* **Topology** by *J. Munkres*: Standard textbook for point-set topology (first part of the book). The focus is on generalizing the properties of continuous funtions learned in Calculus I and III.
* **An Introduction to Manifolds** by *L. Tu*: A good introduction to differential topology (de Rham cohomology). Can skip the Lie group, Lie algebra and Lie derivative discussions during the first reading. Some of its content is similar to the one found in Hubbard and Hubbard's book (eg: Stokes theorem).
   * **Analysis on Manifolds** by *J. Munkres*: A rigorous introduction to manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (de Rham cohomology). This book provides better notations for differentaition and integration, hence clearing the confusion caused due to Calculus notations like "dx" etc. 
   * **Differential Topology** by *A. Mukherjee*: This text nicely complements the study of smooth manifolds. A good reference for Sard's theorem, Whitney's embedding theorem, and Morse theory.
* **An Introduction to Algebraic Topology** by *J. Rotman*: A good introductory text with a good number of examples about fundamental groups and homology theory. Even though it is part of graduate text series, it is quite accessible as compared to the more advanced books by [Massey](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387902715) or [Hatcher](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html).
  * **Elements of Algebraic Topology** by *J. Munkres*: Provides a more detailed discussion about both homology and cohomology.

## Geometry 

* **Geometry from a Differentiable Viewpoint** by *J. McCleary*: The Part B of this books provides a good introduction to geometry of curves and surfaces lying in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (Theorema Egregium and Gauss-Bonnet Theorem). The other two parts are expositions which connect high school geometry with differential geometry (Part A) and introduce Riemannian geometry (Part C).
  * **Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra And Differential Forms: A unified approach** by *J. H. Hubbard and B. B. Hubbard*: A visual introduction to multivariable calculus. It also briefly discusses the geometry of curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Focus is on rigorously proving the stuff learned in Calculus III and extend those ideas. Though "differential forms" are not needed for understanding curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$, they will be useful when learning about Riemannian manifolds (tensor calculus). 
  <!--- In real analysis we extend the scope of Riemann integration by using Lebesgue integration (complete normed linear space). However, as per Lebesgue integration, integration over a curve will be zero since a curve is of measure zero. Therefore, here we first mimic the usual Riemann integration for functions over higher dimensions, and then extend the scope using differential forms (like we used cross product in $\mathbb{R}^3$). But still, the theory of improper Riemann integrals over $\mathbb{R}^n$ is not as powerful as was in the case of functions over $\mathbb{R}$ (improper Riemann integral is more powerful than Legesgue integration over $\mathbb{R}$). --->
* **An Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds and Riemannian Geometry** by *W. Boothby*: This book provides a good introduction to Riemannian manifolds. The content of first four chapters overlap with some of the stuff covered in Tu's book on manifolds. Roughly speaking, geometry has local structure (eg: Gaussian curvature), while topology only has global structure (eg: Euler characteristic). 
  * **Riemannian Geometry: A Beginner's Guide** by *Frank Morgan*: It is a nice reference for visual illustrations needed for a better understanding of Riemannian geometry.
* **Projective Geometry** by *P. Samuel* (translated from the French by S. Levy): The purpose of this book is to give an algebraic introduction to projective spaces. Keep in mind that "projective space" we encounter in algebraic topology/differential geometry and projective geometry/algebraic geometry is different because of the underlying topology ([related discussion](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/2826053/)). For those interested in combinatorics, a good follow up text would be the book "An Introduction to Incidence Geometry" by Bart De Bruyn.
  * **Geometry** by *M. Audin*: This book will help to bridge the gap between high-school geometry (Euclidean plane, Cartesian 2D and 3D, and Argand plane) and university geometry (differential geometry and algebraic geometry). Also, the chapters V and VI of this book supplement the contents of Samuel's book.
* **An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry** by *K. E. Smith, et. al.*: This book nicely complements the first chapter of Hartshorne (rest of that book is about scheme theory). Lots of solved examples. Note that, though "genus" of a curve (Riemann surface) is defined in algebraic topology via Euler charateristic and in (complex) algebraic geometry via Riemann-Roch theorem, there is a close correspondence between "divisors" (algebraic geometry) and holomorphic "line bundles" (algebriac topology) on a Riemann surface. You can find more about this in the last chapter (Chapter 8) of this book. A good follow-up read would be the book "Algebraic Curves" by Fulton ([available online](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf)) where a proof of Riemann-Roch theorem for cruves is discussed.

# Special Topics 
--------------

<img src="/images/book6.jpg" alt="">

The topics and books are arranged in the order I would recommend learning them.

## Elementary Number Theory 

* **An Introduction to Diophantine Equations** by *D. Andrica, I. Cucurezeanu, and T. Andreescu*: A really nice place to learn elementary methods for solving various types of Diophantine equations.
* **The  Higher  Arithmetic** by *H.  Davenport*: It is written in prose form, many interesting things to learn.
* **An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers** by *Ivan Niven, Herbert S. Zuckerman and Hugh L. Montgomery*: Covers all flavours of number theory in adequate detail. Requires some mathematical maturity.
* **Diophantine Approximation** by *W. M. Schmidt*: Standard reference for the general theory. Also contains proofs of theorems belonging to "Geometry of Numbers."
  * **Topics in Number Theory (Volumes I and II)** by *W. J. LeVeque*: The best place to understand the proof of Roth's theorem and Delaunay-Nagell theorem (discussed in the volume 2 part). The volume 1 part can be used as an introduction to elementary number theory.

## Algebraic Number Theory 

* **Number Fields** by *D. Marcus*: A very good introductory text on algebraic number theory (chapters 2 to 5), where most big proofs are in the form of exercises. When I read this book in 2016, it was available only in old typewriter font but fortunately in 2018 Springer released its LaTeX edition! For supplementary reading, it is worth looking into the [expository articles by Keith Conrad](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/).
  * **Algebraic number theory and Fermat's last theorem** by *I. Stewart and D. Tall*: It nicely illustrates the calculation of class numbers using examples.
  * **Algebraic Number Theory, a Computational Approach** by *W. Stein*: The chapters 2 to 8 complement Marcus' book by providing many examples solved using SageMath. It is freely [available online](https://wstein.org/books/ant/).
* **Algebraic Number Theory** by *J. Neukirch* (translated from the German by N. Schappacher): A really nice second introduction to algebraic number theory for someone interested in arithmetic geometry. It serves the purpose of standard reference for global fields and local fields. I have read parts of Chapter I, II, IV and VII.
  * **p-adic Numbers: An Introduction** by *F. Q. Gouvêa*: A good supplementary text for basic facts about $p$-adic numbers.
* **Class Field Theory** by *J.S. Milne*: This is good for learning local class field theory from the perspective of Galois cohomology (unlike Neukirch). I have read parts of Chapter I, II, III and V. It is freely [available online](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/cft.html).
  * **Primes of the Form $x^2 + ny^2$** by *D. Cox*: For a working knowledge of the important results of global class field theory one should read this as per [this advice](https://mathoverflow.net/a/6940/). *I haven't read this book yet.*

## Analytic Number Theory

* **An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers** by *G. H. Hardy and E. M. Wright*: It is a classic textbook with lot of interesting stuff using elementary analytic methods.
  * **Fourier Analysis: An Introduction** by *E. M. Stein and R. Shakarchi*: It is a good reference for "Weyl’s Equidistribution Theorem" (section 4.2) which is closely related to "Kronecker’s Theorem" (Diophantine approximation) discussed in Hardy & Wright's book (section 23.3, latest edition).
* **Making Transcendence Transparent** by *E.B. Burger and R. Tubbs*: Very nice introductory text for learning the techniques used in transcedental number theory.
* **Multiplicative Number Theory** by *H. Davenport*: This is a tough book for introducing analytic number theory, but worth the hardwork since you get to prove Prime Number Theorem with a good estimate. However, anyone interested in analytic number theory must read the chapter 8 about Riemann's contribution (he wrote only one paper!). 
  * **The  Theory  of  Functions** by *E. C. Titchmarsh*. A good reference for the complex analysis used by Davenport. Might also be worth looking at Titchmarsh's other book "The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function."
  * **An  Introduction  to  the  Analytic  Theory  of  Numbers** by *R. Ayoub*: A good supplementary text for the methods and estimates used by Davenport.
  * **A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory** by *K. Ireland and M. Rosen*: Provides a straighforward proof of Dirichlet's theorem on infinite primes arithmetic progressions in chapter 16.
* **Elementary Methods in Number Theory** by *M. B. Nathanson*: The part 3 of this book gives a good introduction to additive number theory. I haven't spent much time on this book since I don't enjoy thinking about combinatorial problems. Nowadays, this field is called "arithmetic combinatorics" and uses ergodic theory and harmonic analysis. 
* **Introduction to Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms** by *N. Koblitz*: A nice introduction to modular forms, which basically adds details and exercises to Serre's condense one chapter introduction in his classic book "A Course in Arithmetic". The study of modular forms is motivated via congruent number problem, and a brief discussion of analytic theory of elliptic curves.
  * **Complex Analysis** by *E. M. Stein and R. Shakarchi*: A good reference for the facts from complex analysis needed for understanding the proofs by Koblitz.
  * **Fuchsian groups** by *S. Katok*: A good reference for understanding the shapes of fundamental domains.

*I didn't continue in this field since I couldn't like the arithmetic functions that keep popping up when finding estimations. If you enjoy this estimation related stuff, next step would be to learn about circle methods. Have a look at the book "An Invitation to Modern Number Theory" by S. J. Miller and R. Takloo-Bighash.*

## Complex Geometry 

* **Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces** by *R. Miranda*: It is a nice introductory text. Its Chapter IX is a good source for learning about Cech cohomology.
  * **Functions of One Complex Variable** by *J. B. Conway*: I really like the proofs given in this book (Runge's theorem, Mittag-Leffler's theorem and Weierstrass factorization theorem) which are critical for understanding Riemann surfaces.
* **From Holomorphic Functions to Complex Manifolds** by *Fritzsche and Grauert*: For analytic subvariety properties. Didn't spend much time on it.
  * **Analytic Functions of Several Complex Variables** by *Gunning and Rossi*: The necessary background about several variable complex valued functions, and a detailed proof of $\overline{\partial}$-Poincare lemma.
  * **Function Theory of Several Complex Variables** by *S. G. Krantz*: The proof of Dolbeault theorem for $\mathbb{C}^n$ is discussed in section 6.3.
  * **Differential Analysis on Complex Manifolds** by *R. O. Wells*: For understanding vector bundles and more.
* **Principles of Algebraic Geometry** by *J. Harris and P. Griffiths*: The only available introductory text on complex algebraic geometry. Not at all a good book for self study, my whole master's thesis was an attempt to understand 14 pages of this book (pp. 34-47): "Any analytic hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}^n$ is the zero-locus of a global holomorphic function." However, trying to understand the given collection of ideas is worth the effort.
  * **Complex Geometry** by *D. Huybrechts*: The first two chapters of this book cover the necessary complex analysis and complex manifolds background needed for Griffiths-Harris. Especially the proof of $\overline{\partial}$-Poincare lemma. The proof of Poincare lemma can be found in Munkres' "Analysis on Manifolds".
  * **Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups** by *W. F. Warner*: Chapter 5 where the equivalence of Cech cohomology to sheaf cohomology is discussed.
  * **Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry** by *F. Hirzebruch* (translated from the German by R. L. E. Schwarzenberger): Section 2 for the relation between Cech and de Rham cohomology.
  
*Initially the plan was to learn [Hodge Theory](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1129603/), but I found this preliminary stuff to be too difficult to grasp. A good reference for that would be the book "Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry" by Claire Voisin.* 
  
## Enumerative Geometry 

* **Enumerative Geometry and String Theory** by *S. Katz*: Standard introductory text. Can be supplemented with the articles: (1) "Enumerative Algebraic Geometry of Conics" by Bashelor, Ksir, and Traves ([MAA](https://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/enumerative-algebraic-geometry-of-conics)), (2) "Introduction to Moduli Spaces: A cycle of lectures at Universidad de Costa Rica" by Renzo Cavalieri ([combined pdf](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/Introduction-to-Moduli-Spaces.pdf))
* **Mirror Symmetry and Algebraic Geometry** by *D. A. Cox and S. Katz*: Standard reference for learning about Gromov-Witten Invariants (chapter 7). Not an easy read. 
  * **Algebraic Geometry** by *A. Gathmann*: A gentle introduction to algebraic geometry with lots of computational exercises oriented towards the useful "intersection theory". There are many editions [available online](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmann/de/alggeom.php), but I have read only the [2002 edition](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmann/class/alggeom-2002/alggeom-2002.pdf).
  * **Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology** by *Bott and Tu*: A good reference for learning to compute the first Chern class of a complex line bundle (Proposition 6.4).
  * **Mirror Symmetry: Proceedings of the CMI summer school held at Pine Manor College, Massachusetts (May 30 - June 25, 2000)** by *C. Vafa, et al.*: For a more gentle introduction to Gromov-Witten Invariants, try reading Chapter 21 to 23 of this book. It is [available online](https://www.claymath.org/library/monographs/cmim01c.pdf) on Clay Mathematics Institute website.
* **An Invitation to Quantum Cohomology: Kontsevich's Formula for Rational Plane Curves** by *Kock and Vainsencher*: A good place to learn teachiniques involved in calculations (haven't read it myself). You can supplement it with the article "Counting Plane Rational Curves: Old and New Approaches" by Aleksey Zinger ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0507105)) and the Ph.D. thesis "Gromov-Witten and degeneration invariants: computation and enumerative significance" by Andreas Gathmann.

*I made an attempt to learn this topic so that I could build upon the skills gained while learning complex geometry. However I didn't make much progress due to the lack of my interest.*

## Arithmetic Geometry 

* **Rational Points on Elliptic Curves** by *J. H. Silverman and J. Tate*: One of the most accessible introduction to the world of elliptic curves, especially the theory of heights (major part of Diophantine geometry). I read the chapters I to III of this book a while ago for Mordell’s theorem (the special case of elliptic curves with a rational point of order two). The appendix on projective geometry is also great. 
  * **Topics in Algebra** by *I. N. Herstein*: This is a reference for the group theory needed to understand the proof of Mordell's theorem discussed in the text.
* **The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves** by *J. H. Silverman*: The standard introductory text about elliptic curves using techniques from algebraic geometry (varieties in projective spaces). Make sure to use the 2nd edition corrected in 2016 printing, since earlier versions have lot of typos. Neukirch's "Algebraic Number Theory" book might be helpful when reading sections II.2, II.3, III.7 and VII.4. Also, it would be useful to recall stuff from analyic number theory, like Riemann zeta function (for section V.2), Diophantine approximation (for section IX.1) and transcendental number theory (for section IX.5).
   * **Basic Algebraic Geometry** by *I. Shafarevich* (translated from the Russian by K. A. Hirsch): This is a reference for many proofs skipped in the first two chapters by Silverman. Note that this is quiet different, in terms of notations and organization, from the newer expanded translation by Miles Reid.
   * **Galois Representations** by *Gabor Wiese*: These notes complement the discussion in section III.7 of Silverman's text. They are [available online](https://math.uni.lu/~wiese/notes/GalRep.pdf).
* **Rational Points on Varieties** by *B. Poonen*: It provides a good introduction to the theory of obstructions to rational points on a variety, while briefly discussing other useful tools like étale cohomology. *In progress.*
  * **Central Simple Algebras and Galois Cohomology** by *P. Gille and T. Szamuely*: This book discusses the proofs and exercises given in the first chapter of Poonen's book. Central Simple Algebras (CSAs) over a field K are a non-commutative analog to extension fields over K – in both cases, they have no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, and have a distinguished field in their center, though a CSA can be non-commutative and need not have inverses (need not be a division algebra). This is of particular interest in "noncommutative number theory" as [generalizations of number fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz_quaternion_order). A detailed discussion of Brauer group examples related to class field theory is available in chapter IV and VIII.4 of Milne's [Class Field Theory notes](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/cft.html).
  * **Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves** by *Q. Liu* (translated from the French by R. Erné): This book discusses the proofs and exercises given in the second and third chapters of Poonen's book. An introduction to the language of schemes (chapters 2 to 7), without assuming the base field to be algebraically closed, or of characteristic zero. Some prior knowledge of complex geometry will be helpful when reading this book.
  * **Arithmetic Geometry: Proceedings of the instructional conference held at the University of Connecticut (Jul 30 - Aug 10, 1984)** edited by *G. Cornell and J. H. Silverman*: The reference to learn basics of advanced topics like Jacobian varieties and Néron Models. It also contains the article by Milne which discusses abelian varieties without assuming ground field to be algebraically closed. Most of the articles are intended as expositions of the tools used in the proof of Faltings' theorem. 
  
<!--- 
* **A First Course in Modular Forms** by *F. Diamond and J. Shurman*: This book explains a result called the Modularity Theorem (Taniyama–Shimura conjecture). The modularity theorem is, [in some sense](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/55449/), a special case of the Langlands program. *I haven't read this book yet.*
  * **Modular Forms and Fermat’s Last Theorem: Proceedings of the instructional conference held at Boston University (Aug 9 - Aug 18, 1995)** edited by *G. Cornell, J.H. Silverman and G. Stevens*: Advanced stuff. 
* **Algebraic Geometry** by *R. Hartshorne*: The chapter II and III of this book provide an introduction to algebraic geometry via the theory of schemes over algebraically closed field. Good reference for the cohomology of schemes. 
  * **Abelian Varieties** by *D. Mumford*: A scheme-theoretic treatment of most of the basic theory of abelian varieties. However, all ground fields are assumed to be algebraically closed, which limits the usefulness of the book as a reference for arithmetic geometers.

## Representation Theory 

* **Representation and Characters of Groups** by *G. James and M. Liebeck*: This is an introductory text for representation theory of finite groups. It could have been an ideal introductory text for undergraduates but they chose [bad notations](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/192728). However, it is more accessible as compared to the standard textbook by [Serre](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-9458-7).
  * **Representation Theory of Finite Groups** by *M. Burrow*: Must read the introduction to the first chapter. Notations are a bit outdated.
* **Introduction to Representation Theory** by *P. Etingof et al.*: The goal of this book is to give a "holistic" introduction to the subject which treats the representation theory of finite groups, Lie algebras and quivers as special cases of the general theory of representations of associative algebras. The pre-print of this book is [available at arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0827). *I haven't read this book yet.*
  * **Representation Theory** by *W. Fulton and J. Harris*: Provides a more detailed discussion about representation theory of groups, associative algebras, and Lie algebras.
* **Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations** by *B. C. Hall*: The Part I of the text develops the theory
of (matrix) Lie groups and their Lie algebras using only linear algebra, without requiring any knowledge of manifold theory. The Part II of the text covers semisimple Lie algebras and their representations. Finally, the Part III of the book presents the compact-group approach to representation theory. Moreover, the results in Parts II and III of the book have been explained and motivated using figures whenever possible. I have only read some topics from the Part I of this book.
* **Fourier Analysis on Number Fields** by *D. Ramakrishnan and R. J. Valenza*: It is an introduction to number theory organized around John Tate’s Ph.D. thesis which uses representation theory for locally compact groups ([review](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2000-37-03/S0273-0979-00-00872-7/S0273-0979-00-00872-7.pdf)). The topics discussed in this book can be of interest for the people working in number theory, harmonic analysis, or the representation theory of Lie groups. *I haven't read this book yet.*
  * **Algebraic Number Theory: Proceedings of the instructional conference held at the University of Sussex (Sep 1 - Sep 17, 1965)** edited by *J. W. S. Cassels and A. Fröhlich*: It contains Tate's doctoral thesis.
* **Automorphic Representations and L-Functions for the General Linear Group: Vol 1 and 2** by *D. Goldfeld and J. Hundley*: The purpose of this book is to provide an elementary yet extremely rigorous exposition of the theory of cuspidal automorphic representations and L-functions for the general linear group in a textbook form that can be understood by the beginning graduate student with minimal background in representation theory ([review](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f68f/8759f764e7c8ea3969c663c14d3c8186b17c.pdf)). Modern research in the theory of automorphic representations and L-functions is largely focused in the direction of the [Langlands program](http://publications.ias.edu/sites/default/files/Representation-theory-rise-and-role-in-number-theory_0.pdf). *I haven't read this book yet.*
* **p-adic Hodge Theory: Lecture notes from the CMI summer school on Galois Representations held at the University of Hawaii, Manoa (Jun 15 - Jul 10, 2009)** by *O. Brinon and B. Conrad*: These notes are for the [foundational course](https://www.claymath.org/galois-representations) focusing on local problems, i.e. p-adic representations of Galois groups of p-adic fields. They are [available online](https://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/brinon_conrad.pdf). Note that the Theorem 1.1.1 stated in the first "Motivation" section of these notes is the Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion and a good reference for that is the Chapter VII of Silverman's book "The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves."  I didn't read these notes properly, since I lack interest in representation theory.
  * **Theory of p-adic Galois Representations** by *J.-M. Fontaine and Y. Ouyang*: An introductory textbook on [𝑝-adic Hodge theory](https://www3.nd.edu/~ajorza/courses/m162b-w2012/) (in preparation, a fruit of Jean-Marc Fontaine's [France-China cooperative program](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202007/rnoti-p1010.pdf) in arithmetic geometry; unfortunately Jean-Marc Fontaine passed away on January 29, 2019). The second draft of this book in [available online](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yiouyang/galoisrep.pdf). Its section 0.2 complements section 4.2 of Brinon & Conrad, and sections 2.2-2.3 complement the section 3 of Brinon & Conrad.  Note that this book uses the [French definition of local fields](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/216632). 
  * **Étale Cohomology and the Weil Conjecture** by *E. Freitag and R. Kiehl* (translated from the German by B. S. Waterhouse and W. C. Waterhouse): This book presents P. Deligne's proof of the last of the Weil conjectures, following his original paper and develops the necessary background material from [étale cohomology](https://www.math.utah.edu/~howe/6370/). Its first section is a good reference for learning about [strict henselization](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BSK) which is used in section 3.2 of Brinon & Conrad.  
  * **Perfectoid Spaces: Lectures from the 2017 Arizona Winter School** edited by *B. Cais*: This is a reference for learning about [modern topics](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gulotta/tt20.html) like the Fargues-Fontaine curve and Scholze’s theory of perfectoid spaces. The lecture notes and problem sets are also [available online](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~swc/aws/2017/index.html). It contains J. Weinstein's lecture notes on "Adic spaces" which are a good source for learning about perfectoid fields and complement the discussion in the section 4.3 of Brinon & Conrad. Note that in Weinstein's notes the nonarchimedian fields are assumed to be complete. Also, [this article by Kiran Kedlaya](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40687-015-0031-z) acts as a bridge between Weinstien and Brinon-Conrad notes. 

*Whatever I have read in this topic is due to its necessity and not due to my personal interest.*
