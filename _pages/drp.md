I often have directed reading project (DRP) ideas in number theory, suitable for motivated undergraduates. Please email me if you wish to learn more about the potential (online/in-person) projects. 

During a DRP, you'll study a topic in number theory for two to three months and have weekly discussions with me. At the end of the reading period, you'll write a short report and present your readings at either your institute (in person) or the University of Arizona's Graduate Number Theory Seminar (online via Zoom).

### FAQs

**Why should you do a DRP?**
1. You'll get an opportunity to explore topics in number theory!
2. You'll also learn about tools like LaTeX, Sage, and Git that can help you become a better researcher.

**Why am I offering a DRP?**
1. I just love to discuss mathematics with people.
2. It will also allow me to finally read that book/paper I never had time for!

**Can you give an example of DRP?**

As an undergraduate, I did seven DRPs with various professors in India. The following is my favorite:

- Title: Number Fields
- Summary: I spent two months learning about algebraic number theory with Prof. Ramesh Sreekantan (ISI Bangalore).  The main reference was Marcus' textbook "Number Fields" which is a standard introductory textbook on algebraic number theory where a big part of the theory is built via exercises. Therefore, I solved many exercises from this book. However, along the way, I also did some explorations using SageMath.

- I later presented what I learned in a student seminar at my institute (NISER Bhubaneswar).
