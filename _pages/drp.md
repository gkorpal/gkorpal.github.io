I often have directed reading project (DRP) ideas in number theory, suitable for motivated undergraduates. Please email me if you wish to learn more about the potential (online/in-person) projects. 

During a DRP, you'll study a topic in number theory for two to three months and have weekly discussions with me. At the end of the reading period, you'll write a short report and present your readings at either your institute (in person) or the University of Arizona's Graduate Number Theory Seminar (online via Zoom).

## FAQs

### Why do a DRP?

1. Get an opportunity to explore topics in number theory!
2. Learn about tools like LaTeX, Sage, and Git that can help one become a better researcher.

### Why are you offering DRPs?

1. I just love to discuss number theory with people.
2. It will also allow me to finally read that book/paper I never had time for!

### Can you give a DRP example?

As an undergraduate, I did seven DRPs with various professors in India. The following is my favorite:

- Title: Number Fields
- Summary: I spent two months learning about algebraic number theory with Prof. Ramesh Sreekantan (ISI Bangalore).  The main reference was Marcus' textbook "Number Fields" which is a standard introductory textbook on algebraic number theory where a big part of the theory is built via exercises. Therefore, I solved many exercises from this book. However, along the way, I also did some explorations using SageMath.

- I later presented what I learned in a student seminar at my institute (NISER Bhubaneswar).

### What is the process for picking reading material for a DRP?
 
1. You tell me which aspect of number theory you would like to explore (elementary, algebraic, analytic, topological, geometric). This mainly depends on your background and interests. If you are not sure, then I can help you choose.
2. I assign you a primary (and secondary) reference based on your mathematical maturity level (e.g. won't ask you to read Marcus' textbook without knowing Galois theory)
3. You make a reading plan (how many hours per week to spend on this and when to start/finish).
4. We meet once every week for an hour to discuss what you learned and, if needed, make adjustments to the plan.
