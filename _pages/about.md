Arithmetic geometry and the related applications in cryptography.

Applications of arithmetic geometry to cryptography; like elliptic curve cryptography ([Koblitz](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1987-48-177/S0025-5718-1987-0866109-5/) and [Miller](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-39799-X_31)), pairing-based cryptography ([Joux](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/10722028_23)), and isogeny-based cryptography ([Couveignes](https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/291), [Rostovtsev-Stolbunov](https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/145), and [Charles-Goren-Lauter](https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/021)).

 The Realm of Arithmetic Geometry (picture taken from Mark Kisin's article ["What is a Galois Representation?"](https://www.ams.org/notices/200706/tx070600718p.pdf)): Here the dashed arrows indicate a conjecture, while the dotted ones indicate partial progress, like the [Serre's conjecture](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~cais/Papers/Expos/Serre05.pdf) proved by Khare and Wintenberger (2008) for the "Wiles, Taylor ..." arrow and [Deligne's reduction](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20259/) of the Ramanujan conjecture to the Weil conjectures using the [Eichler-Shimura theory](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20950/) (1971) for the "Shimura varieties" arrow. Note that, the Langlands program predicts that any algebraic variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ corresponds to an algebraic automorphic form via their L-functions. *An annotated version of this diagram is available at the [LMFDB universe webpage](https://www.lmfdb.org/universe).* I am primarily interested in the properties of rational points on varieties, as discussed in [this article](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-56755-1_13).| The Realm of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (picture taken from Luca De Feo's presentation ["Isogeny Graphs in Cryptography"](https://defeo.lu/docet/assets/slides/2018-05-31-gdr-securite.pdf), hand-drawn by Rachel Deyts): Here [isogeny-based cryptography](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8896171) is shown to find a way around the Quanthom menace, illustrating the crucial role elliptic curves have played in the development of public-key cryptography. Initially, [in 1985](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-39799-X_31), the group structure of their points was used to come up with cryptography protocols. Later, [in 2001](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44647-8_13), a modified version of the usual bilinear pairings defined on their torsion points were introduced to design various protocols. Then, [in 2011](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25405-5_2), graphs whose vertices are (isomorphism classes of) supersingular elliptic curves and edges are isogenies between those curves were used to design protocols for post-quantum cryptography.

**Bonus**: [Neal Koblitz's opinions in his autobiography](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-74078-0_14) about the confluence of pure mathematics and computer science in cryptography.
