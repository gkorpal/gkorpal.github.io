Hi! I am a second year Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona. 

**Office:** ENR2 S390GG ([Environment and Natural Resources 2 Building](https://enr2tour.arizona.edu/))

<!--- **Office Hours:**  On Sundays from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm --->

**email:** gkorpal at math dot arizona dot edu

My research interests lie in arithmetic geometry and the related cryptography applications.

 The Realm of Arithmetic Geometry (picture taken from Mark Kisin's article ["What is a Galois Representation?"](https://www.ams.org/notices/200706/tx070600718p.pdf)): Here the dashed arrows indicate a conjecture, while the dotted ones indicate partial progress, like the [Serre's conjecture](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~cais/Papers/Expos/Serre05.pdf) proved by Khare and Wintenberger (2008) for the "Wiles, Taylor ..." arrow and [Deligne's reduction](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20259/) of the Ramanujan conjecture to the Weil conjectures using the [Eichler-Shimura theory](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20950/) (1971) for the "Shimura varieties" arrow. Note that, the Langlands program predicts that any algebraic variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ corresponds to an algebraic automorphic form via their L-functions. *An annotated version of this diagram is available at the [LMFDB universe webpage](https://www.lmfdb.org/universe).*| The Realm of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (picture taken from Luca De Feo's presentation ["Isogeny Graphs in Cryptography"](https://defeo.lu/docet/assets/slides/2018-05-31-gdr-securite.pdf), hand-drawn by Rachel Deyts): Here [isogeny-based cryptography](https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MITP.2019.2943136) is shown to find a way around the Quanthom menace, illustrating the crucial role elliptic curves have played in the development of public-key cryptography. Initially, [in 1985](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-39799-X_31), the group structure of their points was used to come up with cryptography protocols based on Discrete Logarithm Problem. Later, [in 2001](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44647-8_13), a modified version of the usual bilinear pairings defined on their torsion points was used to design various protocols based on computational Diffie-Hellman problem. Then, [in 2011](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25405-5_2), graphs whose vertices are (isomorphism classes of) supersingular elliptic curves and whose edges are isogenies between those curves were introduced to design protocols for post-quantum cryptography.
