Hi! I am a second year mathematics graduate student at the University of Arizona. I am interested in arithmetic geometry, especially the relationship between "algebraic varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$" and "geometric representations of $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$" shown in this diagram:

| Here the dashed arrows indicate a conjecture, while the dotted ones indicate partial progres, like the [Serre's conjecture](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~cais/Papers/Expos/Serre05.pdf) proof by Khare and Wintenberger (2008) for the "Wiles, Taylor ..." arrow and [Deligne's reduction](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20259/) of the Ramanujan conjecture to the Weil conjectures using the [Eichler-Shimura theory](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20950/) (1971) for the "Shimura varieties" arrow. **Source:** [What is a Galois Representation?](https://www.ams.org/notices/200706/tx070600718p.pdf) by Mark Kisin (June/July 2007). *An annotated version is available at the [LMFDB universe webpage](https://www.lmfdb.org/universe). Note that, the Langlands program predicts that any algebraic variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ corresponds to an algebraic automorphic form via their L-functions.*|
