I am Gaurish, and this is my personal website. I use it to journal my work related to [number theory](https://gkorpal.github.io/reading/book-list#number-theory) and [cryptography](https://gkorpal.github.io/jottings/#cryptography). *I often have directed reading project ideas in number theory, suitable for motivated newcomers. The details are [available here](https://github.com/DRP-NT).*
