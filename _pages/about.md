Hi! I am a second year Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona. 

**Office:** ENR2 S390GG ([Environment and Natural Resources 2 Building](https://enr2tour.arizona.edu/))

<!--- **Office Hours:**  On Sundays from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm --->

**email:** gkorpal at math dot arizona dot edu

My research interests lie in arithmetic geometry and cryptography.

| The Realm of Arithmetic Geometry (taken from Mark Kisin's article ["What is a Galois Representation?"](https://www.ams.org/notices/200706/tx070600718p.pdf)): Here the dashed arrows indicate a conjecture, while the dotted ones indicate partial progres, like the [Serre's conjecture](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~cais/Papers/Expos/Serre05.pdf) proved by Khare and Wintenberger (2008) for the "Wiles, Taylor ..." arrow and [Deligne's reduction](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20259/) of the Ramanujan conjecture to the Weil conjectures using the [Eichler-Shimura theory](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20950/) (1971) for the "Shimura varieties" arrow. Note that, the Langlands program predicts that any algebraic variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ corresponds to an algebraic automorphic form via their L-functions. *An annotated version of this diagram is available at the [LMFDB universe webpage](https://www.lmfdb.org/universe).*|

The Realm of Cryptography (taken from Zach Weinersmith's webcomic ["I propose this as a new rhetorical tactic against people who think anything is complete patternless and inscrutable"](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/soul-2)): Elliptic curves have been crucial for the development of cryptography. Initially, [in 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography), we just exploited the group structure of their points to come up with cryptography protocols based on Discrete Logarithm Problem. Later, [in 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing-based_cryptography), we modified the bilinear pairings defined on their torsion points and designed various protocols based on computational Diffie-Hellman problem. Then, [in 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersingular_isogeny_key_exchange), graphs whose vertices are (isomorphism classes of) supersingular elliptic curves and whose edges are isogenies between those curves were introduced to design protocols for post-quantum cryptography. |
