Hi! I am a second year Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona. 

<!---
My interests lie in arithmetic geometry, especially in the relationship between "algebraic varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$" and "geometric representations of $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$," as shown in this diagram from Mark Kisin's article ["What is a Galois Representation?"](https://www.ams.org/notices/200706/tx070600718p.pdf):

| Here the dashed arrows indicate a conjecture, while the dotted ones indicate partial progres, like the [Serre's conjecture](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~cais/Papers/Expos/Serre05.pdf) proved by Khare and Wintenberger (2008) for the "Wiles, Taylor ..." arrow and [Deligne's reduction](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20259/) of the Ramanujan conjecture to the Weil conjectures using the [Eichler-Shimura theory](https://mathoverflow.net/a/20950/) (1971) for the "Shimura varieties" arrow. Note that, the Langlands program predicts that any algebraic variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ corresponds to an algebraic automorphic form via their L-functions. *An annotated version of this diagram is available at the [LMFDB universe webpage](https://www.lmfdb.org/universe).*|
