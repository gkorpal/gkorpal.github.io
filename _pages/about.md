I am Gaurish, and this is my personal website. I use it to journal my work related to [number theory](https://gkorpal.github.io/reading/book-list#number-theory) and [cryptography](https://gkorpal.github.io/jottings/#cryptography).

Here is a brief description of the contents of this website:
- [Scholarly Articles](https://gkorpal.github.io/scholarly/): Original research.
- [Technical Reports](https://gkorpal.github.io/technical/): Detailed notes I wrote while studying advanced concepts.
- [Lecture Notes](https://gkorpal.github.io/lecture/): Short write-ups on interesting topics I gave a talk on.
- [Reading Lists](https://gkorpal.github.io/reading/): The articles and books I found worth my time.
- [Jottings](https://gkorpal.github.io/jottings/): Curated collections of useful learning resources.
- [Musings](https://gkorpal.github.io/year-archive/): Personal blog posts.
- [CV](https://gkorpal.github.io/cv/): My educational background and work experience.
