Recreational Mathematics Explorations
------
* <a href="https://gkorpal.github.io/posts/2016/07/cross-diagonal-cover-VI/">Cross Diagonal Cover Problem</a>, a puzzle I posed in the form of blog posts on my wordpress blog Gaurish4Math during April-May 2016 (This puzzle was <a href="http://gkorpal.github.io/files/32.pdf">solved by Matthew Scroggs</a> in July 2016).
* <u>Pulsating Checkpoint Sequence</u>
 (<a href="https://oeis.org/A264962">A264962</a>), The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, November 2015. (I discovered this sequence while attempting to solve a <a href="http://gkorpal.github.io/files/20151125-solution-be-still-my-pulsating-sequence.pdf">puzzle posed by Pradeep Mutalik</a> in “Quanta Magazine” in November 2015).
 * <a href="https://gkorpal.github.io/mathematix/">MathematiX Club, NISER - Bhubaneswar</a>: Organized a total of 80 undergraduate seminars from Spring 2015 to Spring 2019 (57 SUMS, 12 SRS, 9 MathToys and 2 OpenDay). Most of the reading material that I gave my juniors to prepare for the SUMS was from the following book series: "MIR Little Mathematics Library", "MAA Anneli Lax New Mathematical Library" and "AMS Mathematical World".
