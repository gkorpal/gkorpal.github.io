Recreational Mathematics Explorations
------
* Wrote and directed a 45-minute magic show called [Math-O-Trick](https://gkorpal.github.io/lecture/2017-04-08-math-o-trick) for the Open Day at NISER on April 08, 2017. It consisted of 11 mathematical card tricks performed by 7 students including me ([Bachet 1](https://gkorpal.github.io/lecture/2017-01-28-bachet1), [Bachet 2](https://gkorpal.github.io/lecture/2017-02-03-bachet2), [Bachet 3](https://gkorpal.github.io/lecture/2017-02-11-bachet3)).
* <a href="https://gkorpal.github.io/mathematix/">MathematiX Club, NISER - Bhubaneswar</a>: Organized a total of 80 undergraduate seminars from Spring 2015 to Spring 2019 (57 SUMS, 12 SRS, 9 MathToys, and 2 OpenDay), and 8 of these were delivered by me (3 SUMS, 2 SRS, 1 MathToys, and 2 OpenDay). Most of the reading material that I gave my juniors to prepare for the SUMS was from the following book series: "MIR Little Mathematics Library", "MAA Anneli Lax New Mathematical Library" and "AMS Mathematical World".
* <a href="https://gkorpal.github.io/posts/2016/07/cross-diagonal-cover-VI/">Cross Diagonal Cover Problem</a>, a puzzle I posed in the form of blog posts on my wordpress blog Gaurish4Math during April-May 2016 (This puzzle was <a href="http://gkorpal.github.io/files/32.pdf">solved by Matthew Scroggs</a> in July 2016).
* <u>Pulsating Checkpoint Sequence</u>
 (<a href="https://oeis.org/A264962">A264962</a>), The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, November 2015. (I discovered this sequence while attempting to solve a <a href="http://gkorpal.github.io/files/20151125-solution-be-still-my-pulsating-sequence.pdf">puzzle posed by Pradeep Mutalik</a> in “Quanta Magazine” in November 2015).
