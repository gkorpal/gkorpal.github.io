In this seminar a brief overview of the computer-related applications of number theory was given. One important example I didn't discuss in this seminar is the work of [Lenore Blum](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Blum/) leading to cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
