In this seminar we discussed the mathematics involved in the working of a post-quantum cryptographic protocol based on isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. Some familiarity with the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves was assumed (for example, see [my Fall 2020 RTG presentation slides](https://gkorpal.github.io/files/fall2020-slides-weil_conjecture_elliptic_curve-gaurish.pdf)).
