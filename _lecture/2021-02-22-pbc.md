In this presentation I discussed pairing-based cryptography, the mathematical concepts involved and its possible applications. I would recommend reading the [extended abstract from Crypto 2001](https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/paper.php?pubkey=1068) to understand the mathematics involved using a concrete example.
