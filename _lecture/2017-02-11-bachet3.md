This was the third lecture of the three lectures I gave on mathematical card tricks. In this lecture we discussed "Gilbreath Principle", "The Great Discovery", "Remembering the Future", and "A Mathematical Wizard". These card tricks were later performed by 7 people during the [NISER Open Day 2017](https://gkorpal.github.io/lecture/2017-04-08-math-o-trick). I just told the theory, how to perform them was taught by Swaroop and Devashish.
