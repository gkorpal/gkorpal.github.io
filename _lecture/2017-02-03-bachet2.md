This was the second lecture of the three lectures I gave on mathematical card tricks. In this lecture we discussed "Peirce Curiosity", "Pairs Repaired", "The Royal Pairs", and "The Cyclic Number". These card tricks were later performed by 7 people during the [NISER Open Day 2017](https://gkorpal.github.io/talks/2017-04-08-math-o-trick). I just told the theory, how to perform them was taught by Swaroop and Devashish.
