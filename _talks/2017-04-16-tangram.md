The tangram (Chinese word, literally: "seven boards of skill") is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat shapes, called tans, which are put together to form shapes. There are infinite possible arrangements that can be created using the seven pieces of tangram. In 1942, two Chinese mathematicians, Fu Traing Wang and Chuan-Chih Hsiung proved that by means of the tangram exactly thirteen convex polygons can be formed. We verified this statement. We also discussed scissors-congruence, Banach-Tarski paradox, and the snug tangram number problem proposed by [Ronald C. Read](https://store.doverpublications.com/0486214834.html).
