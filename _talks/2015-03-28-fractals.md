Fractals constitute a relatively modern discovery; they date to the latter half of the 20th century and may be said to have originated in the work of the French Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. The aim was to show how beautiful the simple iterative processes can be, thus providing motivation for studying fractals. Some definitions related to iterations were introduced. I also showed that we encounter iterations and fractals everyday.
