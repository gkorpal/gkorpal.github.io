Using one of the most remarkable results from Euclidean Geometry "Morleyâ€™s Miracle" as motivation I ventured into real-world geometries. Discussed some examples from our surroundings illustrating non-euclidean geometry. The discovery of non-Euclidean geometries posed an extremely complicated problem to physics, that of explaining whether real physical space was Euclidean as had
earlier been believed, and, if it is not, to what what type of non-Euclidean spaces it belonged. This problem is still not completely resolved.
