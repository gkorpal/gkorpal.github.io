Dattarya Ramchandra Kaprekar was an Indian recreational mathematician who described several classes of natural numbers. The motive of this talk was to give a flavor of Elementary Number Theory and Iterations, by discussing the contributions of D. R. Kaprekar. I discussed Kaprekar Numbers, Kaprekar Routines and Kaprekar Sequences. Nothing more than class 10 mathematics was needed to understand this talk.
