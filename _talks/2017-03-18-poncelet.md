This was the seventh lecture in the series of ten lectures ([SUMS 68 to SUMS 77](https://gkorpal.github.io/mathematix/)) based on the lecture notes of Kyoto University (Japan) weekly mathematics seminars for high school students in [December 1994 and January 1996](https://bookstore.ams.org/mawrld-20). The focus of these lectures is the interplay between topology, functions, geometry and algebra. This lecture is based on the lecture of Kenji Ueno, delivered in 1994, intended to be an introduction to algebraic geometry.
