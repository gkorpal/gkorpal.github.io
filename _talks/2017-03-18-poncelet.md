This was the seventh lecture in the series of ten lectures ([SUMS 68 to SUMS 77](https://gkorpal.github.io/mathematix/)) based on [the lecture notes](https://bookstore.ams.org/mawrld-20) of Kyoto University (Japan) weekly mathematics seminars for high school students in December 1994 and January 1996. In this lecture we saw a proof of Poncelet Closure Theorem.
