Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) states that $x^n+y^n=z^n$ has no integer solution for $n>2$. It is easy to show that if the theorem is true when $n$ equals some integer $r$, then it is true when $n$ equals any multiple of $r$. Since every integer greater than 2 is divisible by 4 or an odd prime, it is sufficient to prove the theorem for $n=4$ and every odd prime. On $19^{th}$ September 1994, Andrew Wiles announced that he had finally completed the proof of FLT. In this seminar we saw an *elementary proof* by Sophie Germain (1823) which can be extended to prove FLT for all prime exponents less than 1700.
